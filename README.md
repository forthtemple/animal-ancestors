Shows the ancestors of 85 common animals and their ancestors all the way up to the first animals Choanoflagellates.
All species information including family tree is located in ancestors.json which is in the root. This json file is loaded and a jsplum tree is created recursively on the fly. 

The species information in the json file is in creole markup format and is converted into html using jscreole.

All tree information was generated with a combination of grok and openai and images were generated with both grok and openai.
