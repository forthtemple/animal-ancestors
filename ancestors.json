        "info": "**Phascolarctos cinereus**, commonly known as the koala, is a marsupial native to Australia. Below is detailed information about the species, including its distribution, evolutionary history, and conservation status.\n\n### Species Distribution\n- **Current Distribution**: Koalas are endemic to Australia and are primarily found in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country. Their range includes parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. They inhabit eucalypt woodlands and forests, as their diet is almost exclusively composed of eucalyptus leaves.\n- **Habitat**: Koalas prefer areas with specific species of eucalyptus trees, which provide both food and shelter. Their habitat has been significantly reduced due to deforestation, urbanization, and land clearing for agriculture.\n\n### First Appearance\n- **Evolutionary History**: The koala, *Phascolarctos cinereus*, belongs to the family Phascolarctidae, which diverged from other marsupials around 40 million years ago during the Eocene epoch. Fossil evidence suggests that the genus *Phascolarctos* appeared around 25 million years ago in the Oligocene or early Miocene. Early relatives of the koala, such as *Litokoala* and *Nimiokoala*, were likely more diverse in diet and habitat than modern koalas.\n- **Modern Koala**: The species *Phascolarctos cinereus* likely emerged more recently, with fossil records dating back to the Pleistocene epoch (around 2.5 million to 12,000 years ago). The koala adapted to a specialized diet of eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and high in toxins, necessitating their low-energy lifestyle and long periods of sleep (up to 18-20 hours a day).\n\n### Extinction Status\n- **Is the Species Extinct?**: No, *Phascolarctos cinereus* is not extinct. However, it is currently listed as **Vulnerable** on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.\n- **Conservation Concerns**: Koalas face significant threats due to habitat loss, climate change, bushfires, disease (notably chlamydia, which affects reproduction and health), and human-related activities such as road accidents and dog attacks. The devastating Australian bushfires of 2019-2020 resulted in the loss of thousands of koalas and vast areas of their habitat, further endangering the species.\n- **Population Trends**: While koalas are not extinct, their populations have declined significantly over the past few decades. In some regions, local populations have experienced dramatic reductions, prompting calls for stronger conservation measures and reclassification to a higher threat level in certain areas.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Koalas are an iconic symbol of Australian wildlife, and efforts are underway to protect their habitats through reforestation, wildlife corridors, and disease management programs.\n- They are not closely related to bears, despite often being called \"koala bears.\" As marsupials, their closest living relatives are wombats.\n\nIf you have further questions or would like more specific details about koala biology, behavior, or conservation efforts, feel free to ask!"

        "ancestor": "Phascolarctidae",
        "info": "**Phascolarctos** is a genus of marsupials that includes the koala, one of Australia's most iconic animals. The genus belongs to the family Phascolarctidae and is the only extant genus in this family. Below is detailed information on the species within this genus, focusing primarily on the living species *Phascolarctos cinereus* (the koala), including its distribution, first appearance, and extinction status.\n\n### Species in the Genus *Phascolarctos*\n1. **Phascolarctos cinereus** (Koala) - The only living species in the genus.\n2. **Extinct Species**: There are fossil species within the genus *Phascolarctos*, such as *Phascolarctos yorkensis* and *Phascolarctos maris*, which are known from the fossil record in Australia. These species are less well-documented compared to the modern koala.\n\n### Distribution of *Phascolarctos cinereus* (Koala)\n- **Current Distribution**: The koala is endemic to Australia and is found in the eastern and southeastern parts of the continent. Its range includes parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Koalas inhabit eucalypt woodlands and forests, as their diet is almost exclusively composed of eucalyptus leaves.\n- **Historical Distribution**: Fossil evidence suggests that koalas and related species once had a broader distribution across Australia, including in areas that are now arid or semi-arid, such as parts of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Their range has contracted over time due to climatic changes and human activities.\n\n### First Appearance of *Phascolarctos*\n- The genus *Phascolarctos* first appeared in the fossil record during the late Oligocene to early Miocene epochs, approximately 25\u201330 million years ago. Early relatives of modern koalas, such as species in the genus *Phascolarctos* or related genera within Phascolarctidae, evolved as specialized arboreal folivores (leaf-eaters) in Australia's ancient rainforests.\n- The modern species, *Phascolarctos cinereus*, likely diverged more recently, with fossil evidence dating back to the Pleistocene epoch (around 2.5 million to 11,700 years ago). The exact timeline of its emergence is still a subject of research, but it is believed to have adapted to a more specialized diet of eucalyptus leaves over time.\n\n### Extinction Status\n- **Phascolarctos cinereus (Koala)**: This species is **not extinct** but is currently listed as **Vulnerable** on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Koalas face significant threats from habitat loss due to deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture, as well as from climate change, disease (such as chlamydia), and bushfires. The devastating Australian bushfires of 2019\u20132020, for example, resulted in significant population declines in some areas.\n- **Extinct Species in the Genus**: Several species within *Phascolarctos* are extinct, known only from fossil remains. These species likely became extinct due to climatic shifts, habitat changes, and possibly competition or predation during the late Pleistocene. Specific extinction dates for fossil species like *Phascolarctos yorkensis* are not well-documented, but they are believed to have disappeared long before human arrival in Australia (around 65,000\u201350,000 years ago).\n\n### Additional Notes on Extinction and Conservation\n- While *Phascolarctos cinereus* is not extinct, its population has declined significantly over the past few decades. In some regions, koalas are locally extinct due to habitat destruction. Conservation efforts are ongoing, including habitat restoration, captive breeding programs, and research into diseases affecting koalas.\n- Fossil evidence indicates that the family Phascolarctidae was more diverse in the past, with multiple genera and species. The extinction of these relatives of the modern koala highlights the impact of long-term environmental changes on specialized species.\n\nIf you would like more detailed information on a specific extinct species within *Phascolarctos* or further details on koala conservation, please let me know!"

    "Phascolarctidae": {
        "ancestor": "Diprotodontia",
        "info": "Phascolarctidae is a family of marsupials that includes the koala, one of Australia's most iconic animals. Below is detailed information about the family, including species distribution, when the species first appeared, and details regarding extinction of related species.\n\n### Overview of Phascolarctidae\nPhascolarctidae is a monotypic family, meaning it currently contains only one living species: the koala (*Phascolarctos cinereus*). However, the family has a fossil record that includes several extinct genera and species. Members of this family are arboreal herbivores, highly specialized for a diet of eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and high in toxins, requiring specific adaptations for digestion.\n\n### Living Species: Koala (*Phascolarctos cinereus*)\n- **Species Distribution**: The koala is native to eastern and southeastern Australia, primarily in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Their distribution is closely tied to the availability of eucalyptus forests and woodlands, as they rely almost exclusively on certain species of eucalyptus trees for food and habitat. Historically, their range was more widespread, but habitat loss due to deforestation, urbanization, and climate change has significantly reduced their distribution.\n- **First Appearance**: The modern koala (*Phascolarctos cinereus*) is believed to have diverged from its ancestors around 3\u20134 million years ago during the Pliocene epoch, based on fossil evidence and molecular studies. The family Phascolarctidae, however, has a longer evolutionary history, dating back to the Oligocene or early Miocene (approximately 25\u201330 million years ago), as evidenced by fossil records of early relatives.\n- **Current Status**: The koala is not extinct but is listed as \"Vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as of recent assessments. Populations have declined due to habitat destruction, bushfires, climate change, disease (such as chlamydia), and human-related impacts. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect their remaining habitats and populations.\n\n### Evolutionary History and Fossil Record of Phascolarctidae\nThe family Phascolarctidae is part of the broader group of diprotodont marsupials, which includes other iconic Australian animals like kangaroos and wombats. Phascolarctids are thought to have diverged from other diprotodonts during the late Oligocene or early Miocene (around 25\u201330 million years ago). Fossil evidence suggests that early members of this family were more diverse than the single species we see today.\n\n- **First Appearance of Phascolarctidae**: The earliest known fossils attributed to the Phascolarctidae family date back to the late Oligocene or early Miocene (approximately 25 million years ago) in Australia. These early fossils belong to extinct genera such as *Nimiokoala* and *Litokoala*, which were smaller than the modern koala and likely had a slightly different diet or ecological niche.\n- **Extinct Genera and Species**: Several extinct genera and species within Phascolarctidae have been identified through fossil records. Some notable examples include:\n  - *Litokoala*: Known from fossils in Queensland, dating to the Miocene (about 15\u201320 million years ago). These were smaller than modern koalas and may have had a less specialized diet.\n  - *Nimiokoala*: Fossils from the same period suggest a similar small size and potentially less dependence on eucalyptus.\n  - *Madakoala*: An extinct genus from the Miocene, also smaller than modern koalas.\n  - *Perikoala*: Another Miocene genus, showing diversity within the family before the dominance of *Phascolarctos*.\n  - *Koobor*: A Pliocene genus, potentially a transitional form leading to the modern koala.\n  - *Phascolarctos stirtoni*: An extinct species of koala from the Pleistocene, larger than the modern koala, often referred to as the \"giant koala.\" It is believed to have gone extinct around 50,000\u2013100,000 years ago, likely due to climate change and habitat shifts, possibly compounded by human arrival in Australia.\n\n- **When Extinct Species Disappeared**: Most extinct Phascolarctidae genera and species disappeared during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs (between 5 and 23 million years ago) as Australia's climate became drier and eucalyptus forests expanded, favoring the more specialized *Phascolarctos* lineage. The \"giant koala\" (*Phascolarctos stirtoni*) persisted into the Pleistocene but became extinct around 50,000\u2013100,000 years ago, during a period of significant environmental change and megafaunal extinctions in Australia.\n\n### Summary\n- **Living Species**: Only one species, *Phascolarctos cinereus* (koala), survives today, distributed in eastern and southeastern Australia. It first appeared around 3\u20134 million years ago.\n- **First Appearance of Family**: The Phascolarctidae family emerged around 25\u201330 million years ago during the late Oligocene or early Miocene.\n- **Extinct Species**: Several genera and species, such as *Litokoala*, *Nimiokoala*, and *Phascolarctos stirtoni* (giant koala), existed in the past but became extinct, with most disappearing between 5\u201323 million years ago, and the giant koala becoming extinct around 50,000\u2013100,000 years ago.\n\nThe koala remains a symbol of Australian wildlife, but its survival is threatened by ongoing environmental challenges. Fossil evidence of its extinct relatives highlights the once-greater diversity within the Phascolarctidae family and the impact of climatic and ecological changes over millions of years."

    "Diprotodontia": {
        "ancestor": "Australidelphia",
        "info": "**Diprotodontia Overview**\n\nDiprotodontia is an order of marsupials, which are pouched mammals primarily native to Australasia. This order includes some of the most well-known marsupials, such as kangaroos, koalas, wombats, and possums. Diprotodontia is characterized by a specific dental structure: they typically have a pair of large, procumbent (forward-projecting) incisors on the lower jaw and a reduced number of upper incisors. The name \"Diprotodontia\" comes from Greek, meaning \"two forward teeth.\"\n\nBelow is detailed information on the species distribution, evolutionary origins, and extinction status of the order Diprotodontia as a whole, since the query refers to the taxonomic group rather than a specific species within it.\n\n---\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nDiprotodontia is predominantly found in Australasia, which includes Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands. Their distribution reflects the evolutionary history of marsupials, which became dominant in this region after the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana.\n\n- **Australia**: The majority of Diprotodontia species are native to Australia, including iconic species like kangaroos (e.g., *Macropus* spp.), koalas (*Phascolarctos cinereus*), and wombats (*Vombatus* and *Lasiorhinus* spp.). Australia hosts a wide variety of habitats, from rainforests to deserts, which support diverse Diprotodontia species.\n- **New Guinea and Surrounding Islands**: Many possums and gliders, such as the cuscus (*Phalanger* spp.), are found in New Guinea and nearby islands like the Moluccas and Timor. This region is a biodiversity hotspot for arboreal Diprotodontia.\n- **Tasmania**: Some species, such as the Tasmanian devil (technically a Dasyuromorphia, not Diprotodontia) and certain possums, are found in Tasmania, an island with unique ecological conditions.\n- **Introduced Ranges**: A few Diprotodontia species, such as the brushtail possum (*Trichosurus vulpecula*), have been introduced to areas outside their native range, like New Zealand, where they are often considered invasive pests.\n\nThere are over 120 living species within Diprotodontia, divided into three suborders: Vombatiformes (wombats and koalas), Phalangeriformes (possums and gliders), and Macropodiformes (kangaroos, wallabies, and relatives). Their habitats vary widely, from terrestrial (e.g., kangaroos in grasslands) to arboreal (e.g., possums in forests).\n\n---\n\n### **When the Species First Appeared**\nDiprotodontia, as an order, first appeared in the fossil record during the late Paleocene to early Eocene epochs, approximately 55\u201350 million years ago (Mya). However, the exact timing and evolutionary divergence are still subjects of research due to the sparse early fossil record of marsupials in Australia.\n\n- **Early Origins**: The earliest known Diprotodontia fossils are from the Oligocene epoch (around 25\u201330 Mya) in Australia, found in sites like Riversleigh in Queensland. These fossils include primitive forms of possums and kangaroo-like ancestors.\n- **Evolutionary Context**: Marsupials, including Diprotodontia, likely originated in South America during the Cretaceous period (over 100 Mya) and migrated to Australia via Antarctica before the continents fully separated. By the time Australia became isolated around 35 Mya, Diprotodontia began to diversify into the wide array of forms seen today.\n- **Diversification**: Major radiations occurred during the Miocene (23\u20135 Mya), when Australia's climate shifted from wet rainforests to drier grasslands, driving the evolution of grazing kangaroos and other specialized forms.\n\nOne of the earliest recognized Diprotodontia genera is *Wynyardi*, a small, possum-like marsupial from the early Miocene (around 20 Mya), which represents an ancestral form of the group.\n\n---\n\n### **Extinction Status: Is Diprotodontia Extinct? If So, When Did It Become Extinct?**\nThe order Diprotodontia as a whole is **not extinct**; it includes many extant (living) species, such as kangaroos, koalas, and possums. However, numerous individual species and genera within Diprotodontia have gone extinct, particularly during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs due to climate change and human impact.\n\n- **Extant Species**: There are approximately 125\u2013140 living species of Diprotodontia today, depending on taxonomic classification. These species continue to thrive in various ecosystems across Australasia, though many face threats from habitat loss, climate change, and introduced predators (e.g., foxes and cats in Australia).\n- **Extinct Species and Genera**: Many Diprotodontia species, especially from the megafauna of the Pleistocene, have gone extinct. Notable examples include:\n  - **Diprotodon**: The largest known marsupial, a giant wombat-like creature (about the size of a rhinoceros), went extinct around 46,000\u201350,000 years ago, likely due to a combination of climate change and human hunting after the arrival of Aboriginal Australians.\n  - **Thylacoleo carnifex**: Known as the \"marsupial lion,\" this powerful predator from the family Thylacoleonidae (related to wombats) became extinct around 40,000\u201350,000 years ago.\n  - **Zygomaturus**: Another large, Diprotodon-like marsupial, extinct during the Late Pleistocene.\n  - **Recent Extinctions**: Some smaller Diprotodontia species have gone extinct in historical times due to European colonization and introduced species. For example, certain species of bandicoots and possums have disappeared from parts of Australia in the last 200 years.\n- **Timing of Extinctions**: The wave of megafaunal extinctions in Australia occurred between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago, coinciding with human arrival and significant environmental changes at the end of the last Ice Age. Smaller species extinctions have continued into the modern era due to habitat destruction and predation.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n- **Conservation Status**: Many living Diprotodontia species are threatened or endangered. For instance, the koala is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and disease (e.g., chlamydia), while some species of possums and gliders are critically endangered.\n- **Fossil Record**: Australia's fossil sites, such as Riversleigh and Naracoorte, provide extensive evidence of Diprotodontia evolution and extinction, showcasing both ancient and megafaunal forms.\n- **Ecological Importance**: Diprotodontia species play key roles in their ecosystems as herbivores, seed dispersers, and prey species.\n\nIf you meant a specific species within Diprotodontia (e.g., Diprotodon itself), please clarify, and I can provide more targeted information. Otherwise, this overview covers the order as a whole."

    "Australidelphia": {
        "ancestor": "Marsupialia",
        "info": "Australidelphia is not a single species but a superorder of marsupials, a group of mammals primarily characterized by giving birth to relatively undeveloped young that typically continue to develop in a pouch. Australidelphia includes most marsupials native to Australasia (Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands) and a few species in South America. Below is detailed information on this superorder, including its distribution, evolutionary history, and extinction status of its members.\n\n### Species Distribution\nAustralidelphia is primarily distributed across Australasia and parts of South America:\n- **Australia and New Guinea**: This region is home to the vast majority of Australidelphian marsupials, including well-known groups such as kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and numerous species of possums and gliders. These species are adapted to a wide range of habitats, from deserts and grasslands to rainforests.\n- **South America**: A smaller number of Australidelphian marsupials are found here, primarily in the order Microbiotheria. The most notable example is the monito del monte (*Dromiciops gliroides*), a small, mouse-like marsupial found in the temperate forests of southern Chile and Argentina. This species is considered a \"living fossil\" due to its ancient lineage.\n\n### Evolutionary History and First Appearance\nAustralidelphia is one of two major groups of marsupials, the other being Ameridelphia (mostly found in the Americas). The evolutionary history of Australidelphia is tied to the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, which included South America, Antarctica, and Australia.\n- **First Appearance**: The earliest known marsupial fossils date back to the Early Cretaceous period, approximately 125 million years ago, in North America and Asia. However, the divergence of Australidelphia from other marsupial lineages likely occurred later, during the Late Cretaceous or early Paleogene, around 60\u201370 million years ago, as Gondwana began to fragment. Fossil evidence suggests that Australidelphian ancestors may have migrated from South America to Australia via Antarctica before the continents fully separated.\n- **Diversification**: Once isolated in Australia, Australidelphian marsupials underwent significant adaptive radiation, diversifying into a wide array of ecological niches in the absence of placental mammals (until the arrival of dingoes and later introductions by humans). In South America, the Australidelphian lineage (Microbiotheria) remained more limited in diversity, likely due to competition with placental mammals and other marsupial groups.\n\n### Extinction Status\nAustralidelphia as a superorder is not extinct; it includes many living species. However, numerous individual species and genera within this group have gone extinct, particularly in Australia, due to environmental changes, human activity, and the introduction of non-native species. Below are key points regarding extinction within Australidelphia:\n- **Extinct Species and Groups**:\n  - Many large Australidelphian marsupials, often referred to as megafauna, became extinct during the Late Pleistocene (around 50,000\u201310,000 years ago). Examples include *Diprotodon* (a giant wombat-like marsupial), *Thylacoleo carnifex* (the marsupial lion), and *Procoptodon* (a giant short-faced kangaroo). These extinctions are often linked to climate change and human hunting after the arrival of Indigenous Australians.\n  - More recently, several smaller Australidelphian species have gone extinct due to European colonization and the introduction of predators like foxes and cats, as well as habitat destruction. A prominent example is the thylacine (*Thylacinus cynocephalus*), also known as the Tasmanian tiger, which became extinct in 1936, with the last known individual dying in captivity.\n- **Current Status**: Many living Australidelphian species are threatened or endangered due to ongoing habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species. For instance, several species of bandicoots, possums, and wallabies are at risk. Conservation efforts in Australia and New Guinea aim to protect these species through habitat restoration and predator control programs.\n\n### Summary of Key Australidelphian Orders\nAustralidelphia includes five extant orders and several extinct ones. Here is a brief overview of the major groups:\n1. **Diprotodontia**: Includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, wombats, and possums. Most are native to Australia and New Guinea. Many species are still extant, though some, like certain pygmy possums, are endangered.\n2. **Dasyuromorphia**: Includes carnivorous marsupials like the Tasmanian devil and quolls. The thylacine, once part of this group, is extinct.\n3. **Peramelemorphia**: Includes bandicoots and bilbies. Several species, such as the desert bandicoot, are extinct, while others are threatened.\n4. **Notoryctemorphia**: Includes the marsupial moles, which are rare and elusive but still extant in Australian deserts.\n5. **Microbiotheria**: Found in South America, with the monito del monte as the only living representative. This order is a relic of the ancient Gondwanan distribution of Australidelphia.\n\nIn conclusion, Australidelphia represents a diverse and ancient lineage of marsupials with a rich evolutionary history. While many species have gone extinct over millions of years, particularly in the last 50,000 years, numerous species persist today, though often under significant conservation threats.

    "Marsupialia": {
        "ancestor": "Theria",
        "info": "Marsupialia, commonly referred to as marsupials, is an infraclass of mammals characterized by a distinctive reproductive trait: the presence of a pouch (marsupium) in females, where the young are carried and nursed after a short gestation period. Marsupials are one of the three major groups of mammals, alongside monotremes (egg-laying mammals) and placentals (mammals with longer gestation periods and more developed placentas).\n\n### Species Distribution\nMarsupials are primarily found in Australasia and the Americas, with a unique distribution shaped by historical biogeography and continental drift. Their distribution can be broken into two main regions:\n\n1. **Australasia**: The majority of marsupial diversity is found in Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands. This includes iconic species such as kangaroos, koalas, wallabies, wombats, and the Tasmanian devil. Australia is often considered the center of marsupial diversity, with over 200 species.\n   \n2. **Americas**: Marsupials are also present in South, Central, and North America, though with less diversity compared to Australasia. The most well-known American marsupial is the opossum, with species like the Virginia opossum found in North America. South America hosts a variety of opossums and the monito del monte, a small marsupial from Chile and Argentina.\n\nHistorically, marsupials were more widespread, with fossil evidence indicating their presence in Europe, Asia, and Antarctica during earlier geological periods. However, competition with placental mammals and changing environmental conditions led to their decline in many regions.\n\n### When Marsupials First Appeared\nMarsupials are believed to have originated during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous period, approximately 160\u2013125 million years ago. The earliest known marsupial-like fossils, such as *Sinodelphys szalayi* from China (dated to about 125 million years ago), suggest that marsupials or their close relatives emerged in the Northern Hemisphere, likely in what is now Asia. These early ancestors diverged from the lineage leading to placental mammals.\n\nMarsupials are thought to have spread to other continents via land bridges, particularly through Gondwana (the southern supercontinent that included South America, Africa, Antarctica, and Australia). By the time Gondwana broke apart, marsupials had established populations in South America and Australasia, where they underwent significant diversification in isolation from placental mammals.\n\n### Extinction Status and Historical Extinctions\nMarsupials as a group are not extinct; they remain a diverse and successful infraclass with over 330 extant species. However, many individual marsupial species have gone extinct, and others are currently threatened due to habitat loss, climate change, introduced species, and human activities.\n\n#### Notable Extinct Marsupial Species and When They Became Extinct:\n1. **Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger)** - *Thylacinus cynocephalus*: Native to Tasmania, mainland Australia, and New Guinea, the thylacine was a large carnivorous marsupial. It became extinct on mainland Australia thousands of years ago due to competition with dingoes (introduced by humans), but survived in Tasmania until the 20th century. The last known thylacine died in captivity in 1936, largely due to hunting, habitat destruction, and disease.\n   \n2. **Diprotodon**: A giant wombat-like marsupial, Diprotodon was the largest known marsupial to have ever lived, reaching the size of a rhinoceros. It roamed Australia during the Pleistocene epoch and became extinct around 46,000 years ago, likely due to a combination of climate change and human hunting after the arrival of Aboriginal Australians.\n\n3. **Thylacosmilus**: An extinct saber-toothed marsupial from South America, Thylacosmilus lived during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs (approximately 10\u20133 million years ago). It became extinct around 3 million years ago, possibly due to competition with placental predators like saber-toothed cats after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed faunal exchange between North and South America.\n\n#### Current Status of Marsupials:\nWhile many marsupial species are still thriving, particularly in Australia, numerous species are endangered or critically endangered. For example:\n- The northern hairy-nosed wombat (*Lasiorhinus krefftii*) is one of the rarest mammals in the world, with only a small population remaining in Queensland, Australia.\n- Several species of bandicoots and bilbies are at risk due to habitat destruction and predation by introduced species like foxes and cats.\n\nConservation efforts in Australia and the Americas are ongoing to protect marsupial habitats, control invasive species, and support breeding programs for threatened species.\n\n### Summary\n- **Distribution**: Primarily Australasia (Australia, New Guinea) and the Americas (North, Central, and South America), with historical presence on other continents.\n- **First Appearance**: Approximately 160\u2013125 million years ago, during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous, with early fossils found in Asia.\n- **Extinction Status**: Marsupials as a group are not extinct, but many species, such as the thylacine (extinct in 1936) and Diprotodon (extinct ~46,000 years ago), have disappeared due to natural and human-induced causes. Many living species are currently threatened.\n\nIf you would like more detailed information on a specific marsupial species or region, please let me know!"

    "Theria": {
        "ancestor": "Mammalia",
        "info": "Theria is a subclass of mammals that includes the vast majority of living mammals. It is characterized by the presence of viviparous reproduction (giving birth to live young) and the possession of mammary glands for nursing offspring. Theria is divided into two main infraclasses: **Eutheria** (placental mammals) and **Metatheria** (marsupials). Below is detailed information about the species distribution, first appearance, and extinction status of Theria as a group.\n\n### Species Distribution\nTheria encompasses a wide range of mammals distributed across the globe, found on every continent and in nearly every habitat, from terrestrial to aquatic environments. Their distribution reflects the adaptability and diversity of the two main groups:\n\n- **Eutheria (Placental Mammals):** This group includes over 5,000 species, such as humans, dogs, whales, bats, and elephants. They are found worldwide, from the Arctic to the tropics, and in diverse ecosystems including forests, deserts, grasslands, and oceans. Placental mammals dominate mammalian diversity in most regions, particularly in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.\n  \n- **Metatheria (Marsupials):** This group includes around 330 species, such as kangaroos, koalas, opossums, and Tasmanian devils. Marsupials are primarily found in Australia and New Guinea, where they are the dominant native mammals, as well as in South America (e.g., opossums). A few species, like the Virginia opossum, are found in North America. Their distribution is more limited compared to placental mammals due to historical geographic isolation.\n\n### First Appearance\nTheria is believed to have first appeared during the **Early Jurassic** period, approximately 160\u2013180 million years ago. The earliest known therian mammals are represented by fossil evidence from the Jurassic period, such as *Juramaia sinensis*, a small, shrew-like mammal from China dated to about 160 million years ago. This fossil is considered one of the earliest known eutherian ancestors. Early therians likely diverged from other mammalian lineages, such as monotremes (egg-laying mammals like the platypus), during the Mesozoic Era.\n\n- **Eutheria and Metatheria Divergence:** The split between eutherian (placental) and metatherian (marsupial) lineages is thought to have occurred around 125\u2013160 million years ago, based on molecular and fossil evidence. Early therians were small, insectivorous or omnivorous creatures that lived in the shadow of dinosaurs.\n\n### Extinction Status\nTheria as a subclass is **not extinct** and is, in fact, the most successful and diverse group of mammals alive today. Both Eutheria and Metatheria continue to thrive, though certain species within these groups have gone extinct over time due to natural causes, habitat loss, climate change, or human activity.\n\n- **Extinct Therian Lineages:** While Theria itself is not extinct, some early therian lineages and species have disappeared. For example:\n  - Many Mesozoic therian mammals, such as early multituberculates (a now-extinct group of rodent-like mammals sometimes classified near Theria), went extinct by the end of the Eocene epoch (around 33.9 million years ago).\n  - Specific marsupial and placental species have gone extinct in recent history, such as the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger), a marsupial that became extinct in 1936 due to hunting and habitat loss, and numerous prehistoric placental mammals like saber-toothed cats (extinct around 10,000 years ago).\n\n- **Modern Status:** Today, Theria represents over 95% of all living mammal species, with thousands of species of placental mammals and hundreds of marsupial species still extant. However, many therian species are currently threatened or endangered due to human activities, including deforestation, climate change, and hunting.\n\n### Summary\n- **Distribution:** Theria is globally distributed, with placental mammals (Eutheria) dominating most continents and marsupials (Metatheria) primarily in Australia, New Guinea, and the Americas.\n- **First Appearance:** Approximately 160\u2013180 million years ago during the Early Jurassic, with early fossils like *Juramaia sinensis*.\n- **Extinction Status:** Theria is not extinct; it is a thriving subclass of mammals. However, specific species and lineages within Theria have gone extinct over millions of years, with some recent extinctions like the thylacine in the 20th century.\n\nIf you would like more detailed information on a specific therian species or subgroup, please let me know!"

    "Mammalia": {
        "ancestor": "Cynodontia",
        "info": "**Mammalia (Mammals)**\n\nMammalia is a class of vertebrate animals characterized by the presence of mammary glands (which produce milk to nourish their young), hair or fur, and a neocortex region in the brain, among other traits. Mammals are warm-blooded (endothermic) and most give birth to live young, though some lay eggs (monotremes).\n\n### Species Distribution\nMammals are found across the globe, inhabiting nearly every terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environment. Their distribution spans all continents, including polar regions, deserts, rainforests, grasslands, and oceans. There are approximately 6,400 extant species of mammals, divided into three main groups:\n1. **Monotremes** (egg-laying mammals, e.g., platypus and echidnas): Found primarily in Australia and New Guinea.\n2. **Marsupials** (pouched mammals, e.g., kangaroos, koalas, and opossums): Predominantly found in Australia, with some species in the Americas.\n3. **Placentals** (eutherian mammals, e.g., humans, elephants, whales, and bats): Distributed worldwide, dominating most ecosystems.\n\nMammals have adapted to diverse habitats, from the Arctic tundra (e.g., polar bears) to deep oceans (e.g., whales and dolphins) and tropical forests (e.g., primates and big cats).\n\n### When Mammals First Appeared\nMammals first appeared during the Late Triassic period, approximately 225-230 million years ago (Mya). The earliest known mammals were small, shrew-like creatures that evolved from a group of synapsids called cynodonts. These early mammals coexisted with dinosaurs and likely lived nocturnal, insectivorous lifestyles. One of the earliest known mammal genera is *Morganucodon*, which lived around 205 Mya. True mammals are defined by specific skeletal and dental features, distinguishing them from their synapsid ancestors.\n\nThe diversification of mammals accelerated after the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period (about 66 Mya), which wiped out non-avian dinosaurs. This event allowed mammals to occupy ecological niches previously dominated by dinosaurs, leading to the evolution of modern mammalian groups during the Paleogene period.\n\n### Extinction Status\nThe class Mammalia is **not extinct**; it includes a vast array of living species, including humans (*Homo sapiens*). However, many individual mammalian species have gone extinct over geological time, and some are currently threatened or endangered due to human activity, habitat loss, climate change, and other factors.\n\n#### Notable Extinct Mammalian Groups and Species:\n- **Megaloceros giganteus** (Irish Elk): Extinct around 7,700 years ago, likely due to climate change and human hunting.\n- **Smilodon fatalis** (Saber-toothed Cat): Extinct around 10,000 years ago during the late Pleistocene, possibly due to climate change and loss of prey.\n- **Mammuthus primigenius** (Woolly Mammoth): Extinct around 4,000 years ago on Wrangel Island, though most populations disappeared around 10,000 years ago due to climate warming and human hunting.\n- **Thylacinus cynocephalus** (Thylacine or Tasmanian Tiger): Extinct in 1936, primarily due to human hunting and habitat destruction in Tasmania.\n- **Numerous prehistoric groups**: Entire orders of mammals, such as multituberculates (extinct rodent-like mammals) and creodonts (extinct carnivorous mammals), disappeared over millions of years due to competition, environmental changes, or other evolutionary pressures.\n\n#### Current Status:\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), over 1,200 mammal species are currently threatened with extinction. Iconic species like the African elephant, Amur leopard, and various whale species face significant risks. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these species and their habitats.\n\nIf you meant a specific species within Mammalia rather than the class as a whole, please provide the name, and I can offer detailed information on that particular species."

        "info": "**Cynodontia Overview**\n\nCynodontia is a group of therapsids, which are synapsid amniotes, often referred to as \"mammal-like reptiles.\" Cynodonts are significant in evolutionary biology because they are the direct ancestors of modern mammals. This group exhibits a transition from reptilian to mammalian characteristics, including differentiated teeth, a secondary palate, and evidence of warm-bloodedness.\n\n**Species Distribution**\n\nCynodonts were globally distributed during their time, with fossils found across various continents, reflecting their adaptability to diverse environments. Their distribution includes:\n- **South America**: Particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where early cynodonts like *Probainognathus* and *Brasilodon* have been discovered in Triassic formations.\n- **Africa**: Southern Africa, especially in South Africa, has yielded numerous cynodont fossils, including *Thrinaxodon* and *Cynognathus*, from the Early Triassic Karoo Basin.\n- **North America**: Fossils from the Late Triassic, such as those of *Dromatherium* and *Microconodon*, have been found in the eastern United States.\n- **Europe, Asia, and Antarctica**: Cynodont fossils, including advanced forms like *Morganucodon*, have been found in regions of Europe (e.g., the UK), China, and even Antarctica, indicating their widespread presence during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic.\n\n**First Appearance**\n\nCynodontia first appeared in the fossil record during the Late Permian period, approximately 260 million years ago. The earliest known cynodonts, such as *Procynosuchus*, were small, carnivorous or insectivorous animals that lived in what is now South Africa and Russia. These early forms emerged just before the Permian-Triassic extinction event, one of the most severe mass extinctions in Earth's history, and survived into the Triassic.\n\n**Extinction Status and Timeline**\n\nCynodontia, as a broader group, is not entirely extinct. While many lineages of non-mammalian cynodonts died out, the group gave rise to mammals, which are considered part of the cynodont lineage. The non-mammalian cynodonts, however, largely disappeared by the end of the Triassic period, around 201 million years ago, with a few lingering into the Early Jurassic.\n\n- **Non-Mammalian Cynodont Extinction**: Most non-mammalian cynodonts, such as the large carnivorous *Cynognathus* and herbivorous traversodontids, became extinct during the Late Triassic, likely due to competition with early dinosaurs and environmental changes associated with the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. By the Early Jurassic (around 200-190 million years ago), most non-mammalian cynodont diversity had vanished.\n- **Transition to Mammals**: The cynodont lineage continued through early mammal-like forms such as *Morganucodon* and *Sinoconodon*, which appeared in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic (around 200 million years ago). These forms are often classified as basal mammaliaforms, marking the transition to true mammals, which persist today.\n\nIn summary, while non-mammalian cynodonts are extinct, having largely disappeared by the Early Jurassic, their evolutionary legacy continues through mammals, including humans. Their fossils provide critical insights into the evolutionary steps that led to mammalian traits. If you would like detailed information on a specific cynodont genus or species, please let me know!"

    "Therapsida": {
        "ancestor": "Synapsida",
        "info": "Therapsida is an extinct group of synapsids, which are a clade of animals that includes mammals and their close relatives. Therapsids are often referred to as \"mammal-like reptiles,\" though they are not true reptiles; they represent an evolutionary bridge between early synapsids and modern mammals. Below is detailed information on Therapsida regarding their species distribution, first appearance, and extinction.\n\n### Overview of Therapsida\nTherapsida is a major subgroup of synapsids that emerged during the Permian period and played a significant role in the evolution of mammals. They are characterized by several mammalian traits, such as differentiated teeth (incisors, canines, and molars), more upright limb postures, and evidence of endothermy (warm-bloodedness) in some lineages.\n\n### Species Distribution\nTherapsids were globally distributed during their existence, with fossils found on every continent, including Antarctica. Their distribution reflects the fact that during the Permian and Triassic periods, the Earth's landmasses were largely united as the supercontinent Pangaea, allowing for wide dispersal. Key regions where therapsid fossils have been discovered include:\n- **South Africa**: The Karoo Basin is one of the richest sources of therapsid fossils, particularly from the Permian and Triassic periods. This region has yielded fossils of early therapsids like Biarmosuchus as well as more derived forms like dicynodonts and cynodonts.\n- **Russia**: Permian therapsid fossils, including gorgonopsians and early cynodonts, have been found in regions like the Ural Mountains.\n- **South America**: Triassic therapsid fossils, particularly cynodonts, have been discovered in Brazil and Argentina.\n- **Antarctica and Australia**: Fossils of dicynodonts and other therapsids have been found, indicating their presence in southern Gondwana.\n- **North America and Europe**: Therapsid fossils are less common in these regions but have been found in Triassic deposits.\n\nTherapsids occupied a variety of ecological niches, ranging from small insectivores to large herbivores (like dicynodonts) and apex predators (like gorgonopsians).\n\n### First Appearance\nTherapsids first appeared during the **Middle Permian period**, approximately **270 million years ago**. The earliest known therapsids belong to the subgroup Biarmosuchia, with fossils like *Biarmosuchus* from Russia representing some of the most primitive forms. They evolved from earlier synapsids known as pelycosaurs, a more basal group that includes the famous *Dimetrodon*. Therapsids quickly diversified during the Late Permian, becoming the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of their time.\n\n### Extinction and Legacy\nTherapsida as a whole did not go extinct in a single event but rather experienced a gradual decline with most lineages disappearing over time, except for the lineage that led to mammals. Here's a breakdown of their decline and extinction:\n- **End-Permian Mass Extinction (252 million years ago)**: This was the most significant extinction event in Earth's history, wiping out approximately 90-95% of all species. Many therapsid groups, including gorgonopsians (large carnivorous therapsids), were completely wiped out. However, some lineages, such as dicynodonts and cynodonts, survived into the Triassic period.\n- **Triassic Period**: During the Early and Middle Triassic, therapsids like dicynodonts (e.g., *Lystrosaurus*) were among the dominant herbivores and were incredibly successful, with *Lystrosaurus* making up a significant portion of post-extinction fauna. Cynodonts, a subgroup of therapsids, also thrived and became increasingly mammal-like.\n- **Late Triassic Decline**: By the Late Triassic (around 230-200 million years ago), most non-cynodont therapsid lineages, such as dicynodonts and therocephalians, became extinct, likely due to competition with emerging archosaurs (early dinosaurs and their relatives) and changing environmental conditions.\n- **Cynodonts and the Rise of Mammals**: Cynodonts, the most derived therapsids, continued to evolve and gave rise to the first true mammals by the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic (around 200-160 million years ago). Cynodonts themselves became extinct as distinct non-mammalian forms by the Early Jurassic, with their descendants surviving as mammals.\n\nIn summary, while most therapsid lineages went extinct by the end of the Triassic (approximately 200 million years ago), their evolutionary legacy persists in modern mammals, including humans. Therapsida as a group is considered \"extinct\" in the sense that no non-mammalian therapsids survive today, but their direct descendants (mammals) are a thriving group.\n\nIf you'd like more specific information about particular therapsid subgroups (e.g., cynodonts, dicynodonts, or gorgonopsians), feel free to ask!"

        "ancestor": "Amniota",
        "info": "Synapsida is not a single species but a major clade of amniotes that includes mammals and their extinct relatives, often referred to as \"mammal-like reptiles.\" Synapsids are characterized by a single temporal fenestra (an opening in the skull behind the eye) on each side of the head, which distinguishes them from other amniotes like diapsids (which include reptiles and birds, with two temporal fenestrae).\n\nBelow is an overview of the Synapsida clade, focusing on their distribution, first appearance, and extinction status of key groups within the clade.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\n- **Geographic Distribution**: Synapsids originated on the supercontinent Pangaea during the late Carboniferous and early Permian periods, meaning their early distribution was global across what is now North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Fossil evidence of early synapsids (like pelycosaurs) is found in regions such as the southwestern United States (e.g., Texas) and parts of Europe. Later, during the Triassic, more advanced synapsids (like cynodonts, early mammal relatives) are found in South Africa, South America, and Antarctica, reflecting the breakup of Pangaea.\n- **Modern Distribution**: Living synapsids are represented by mammals, which are distributed globally across all continents and oceans, from polar regions to tropical zones, and include terrestrial, aquatic, and volant (flying) species.\n\n### **First Appearance**\n- Synapsids first appeared in the fossil record during the late Carboniferous period, approximately 315\u2013300 million years ago (Mya). The earliest known synapsids are part of a group called pelycosaurs, with genera like *Archaeothyris* (found in Nova Scotia, Canada) dating to around 306 Mya. These early synapsids were small, lizard-like animals and represent some of the first amniotes to diversify after the split between synapsids and sauropsids (the lineage leading to reptiles and birds).\n\n### **Extinction Status and Key Extinction Events**\n- **Extinct Groups**: Many synapsid lineages are extinct, particularly the non-mammalian synapsids. The history of synapsid extinction is tied to major mass extinction events:\n  - **Permian-Triassic Extinction (252 Mya)**: This was the most severe mass extinction in Earth's history, wiping out approximately 90\u201396% of all species. Many dominant synapsid groups, such as the pelycosaurs (e.g., *Dimetrodon*) and early therapsids, went extinct or were severely reduced. However, some therapsid lineages, including cynodonts, survived and later gave rise to mammals.\n  - **Triassic-Jurassic Extinction (201 Mya)**: This event affected some non-mammalian synapsid lineages, but by this time, early mammals were beginning to emerge, and the synapsid lineage continued through these forms.\n  - **Non-Mammalian Synapsids**: Most non-mammalian synapsids, such as gorgonopsians, dicynodonts, and therocephalians, became extinct by the end of the Triassic or early Jurassic (around 200\u2013180 Mya), as mammals and other groups like dinosaurs became more prominent.\n- **Living Representatives**: The only surviving synapsids are mammals, which first appeared in the fossil record during the late Triassic, around 225\u2013200 Mya, with early forms like *Morganucodon*. Mammals diversified significantly after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event (66 Mya), which eliminated non-avian dinosaurs and allowed mammals to occupy new ecological niches.\n\n### **Key Groups Within Synapsida**\n1. **Pelycosaurs** (Early Synapsids):\n   - Appeared: Late Carboniferous (~306 Mya).\n   - Extinct: By the end of the early Permian (~270 Mya) for most lineages.\n   - Notable genera: *Dimetrodon*, often recognized for its sail-like dorsal structure.\n2. **Therapsids** (More Advanced Synapsids):\n   - Appeared: Early Permian (~275 Mya).\n   - Extinct: Many lineages died out during the Permian-Triassic extinction; non-mammalian therapsids largely disappeared by the early Jurassic (~180 Mya).\n   - Notable groups: Gorgonopsians (predatory synapsids), dicynodonts (herbivorous synapsids), and cynodonts (ancestors of mammals).\n3. **Cynodonts** (Direct Ancestors of Mammals):\n   - Appeared: Late Permian (~260 Mya).\n   - Extinct: Non-mammalian cynodonts largely went extinct by the early Jurassic (~180 Mya).\n   - Notable genera: *Cynognathus*, an early Triassic cynodont.\n4. **Mammals** (Living Synapsids):\n   - Appeared: Late Triassic (~225\u2013200 Mya).\n   - Extinction Status: Not extinct; mammals are the only surviving synapsid group, with over 6,000 species today, including monotremes, marsupials, and placentals.\n\n### **Summary**\nSynapsida as a clade originated around 315\u2013300 Mya in the late Carboniferous, with a global distribution during the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras on Pangaea. Many synapsid lineages became extinct during major events like the Permian-Triassic extinction (252 Mya), with non-mammalian synapsids largely disappearing by the early Jurassic (~180 Mya). The only surviving synapsids are mammals, which first appeared in the late Triassic and continue to thrive today.

    "Amniota": {
        "ancestor": "Tetrapoda",
        "info": "**Amniota Overview**\n\nAmniota is a clade of tetrapod vertebrates that includes reptiles, birds, and mammals. The defining characteristic of amniotes is the presence of an amniotic egg, which contains specialized membranes (amnion, chorion, and allantois) that protect the embryo and allow it to develop in a terrestrial environment. This adaptation enabled amniotes to reproduce away from water, distinguishing them from amphibians, which generally require aquatic environments for reproduction.\n\n**Species Distribution**\n\nAmniotes are found worldwide across a vast range of habitats, from deserts to polar regions, and from terrestrial to aquatic environments. The clade is incredibly diverse, encompassing:\n- **Reptiles** (e.g., lizards, snakes, turtles, crocodiles): Found on every continent except Antarctica, with species adapted to deserts, forests, wetlands, and oceans.\n- **Birds**: Distributed globally, inhabiting nearly every ecosystem, from tropical rainforests to Arctic tundras.\n- **Mammals**: Also globally distributed, including terrestrial, marine (e.g., whales), and volant (e.g., bats) forms, adapted to a wide variety of climates and environments.\n\nThe distribution of specific amniote species depends on their ecological niche, evolutionary history, and adaptations to local conditions.\n\n**First Appearance**\n\nAmniotes first appeared during the late Carboniferous period, approximately 340\u2013310 million years ago (Mya). The earliest known amniote fossils, such as *Hylonomus lyelli*, date to around 312 Mya and were discovered in what is now Nova Scotia, Canada. These early amniotes were small, lizard-like creatures that likely evolved from reptiliomorph ancestors, a group of tetrapods transitional between amphibians and true amniotes. The evolution of the amniotic egg was a key innovation that allowed these early amniotes to colonize drier environments.\n\nThe split between the two major amniote lineages\u2014**Synapsida** (leading to mammals) and **Sauropsida** (leading to reptiles and birds)\u2014occurred shortly after the origin of Amniota, likely in the late Carboniferous or early Permian period (around 310\u2013300 Mya).\n\n**Extinction Status**\n\nAmniota as a clade is not extinct; it is a highly successful and extant group that includes millions of living species. However, many individual lineages and species within Amniota have gone extinct over geological time due to mass extinction events, climate change, and other factors. Below are some notable extinct groups within Amniota and when they became extinct:\n\n- **Non-avian Dinosaurs**: Part of the Sauropsida lineage, non-avian dinosaurs dominated terrestrial environments during the Mesozoic Era but largely went extinct around 66 Mya during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, likely caused by a massive asteroid impact combined with volcanic activity. Birds, which are direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs, survived and diversified.\n- **Pterosaurs**: Flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs, pterosaurs went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous, around 66 Mya, during the K-Pg extinction event.\n- **Marine Reptiles (e.g., Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Mosasaurs)**: These groups thrived in Mesozoic oceans but also became extinct around 66 Mya during the K-Pg event.\n- **Synapsid Relatives of Mammals (e.g., Dimetrodon, Gorgonopsians)**: Many early synapsids, which are part of the lineage leading to mammals, went extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event around 252 Mya, the largest mass extinction in Earth's history. Some synapsid lineages survived and eventually gave rise to mammals.\n- **Numerous Individual Species**: Countless species of reptiles, birds, and mammals have gone extinct over time due to habitat loss, competition, predation, and human activity (e.g., the dodo, passenger pigeon, and thylacine in recent centuries).\n\nIn summary, while Amniota as a group persists and thrives today, many of its subgroups and species have faced extinction at various points in Earth's history, particularly during mass extinction events. The clade's adaptability, particularly through innovations like the amniotic egg, endothermy in birds and mammals, and diverse reproductive strategies, has ensured its long-term survival and dominance in terrestrial ecosystems."

This group encompasses amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including humans. Tetrapods are characterized by having (or having descended from ancestors with) four limbs or limb-like appendages, though some lineages have secondarily lost limbs (e.g., snakes and whales).\n\n### Species Distribution\nTetrapods are found worldwide across nearly every terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial habitat. Their distribution varies depending on the specific group:\n- **Amphibians** (e.g., frogs, salamanders): Primarily found in moist environments near freshwater, though some species inhabit deserts or arboreal habitats. They are distributed across all continents except Antarctica.\n- **Reptiles** (e.g., snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles): Found in a wide range of habitats, from deserts to rainforests and oceans. They are most diverse in tropical and subtropical regions and are present on all continents except Antarctica.\n- **Birds**: Found globally in virtually every habitat, from polar regions to tropical forests, deserts, and oceans. They are highly mobile due to flight capabilities.\n- **Mammals** (e.g., humans, whales, bats): Distributed across all continents and oceans, occupying diverse habitats including terrestrial, marine, and aerial environments.\n\n### When Tetrapoda First Appeared\nTetrapods first appeared during the Late Devonian period, approximately **375\u2013360 million years ago**. The transition from aquatic to terrestrial life is one of the most significant events in vertebrate evolution. Early tetrapods evolved from lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii), which had bony fins that could support weight on land. Fossil evidence of early tetrapods, such as *Acanthostega* and *Ichthyostega*, shows they likely lived in shallow, swampy environments and had both aquatic and terrestrial adaptations. These early forms still retained many fish-like features, such as gills, alongside primitive limbs.\n\nThe oldest known tetrapod trackways, found in Poland, date to about 395 million years ago, suggesting that tetrapods may have emerged even earlier than previously thought, though skeletal fossils from this time are scarce.\n\n### Extinction Status\nTetrapoda as a group is **not extinct** and remains a highly diverse and successful clade. However, many individual species and lineages within Tetrapoda have gone extinct over millions of years due to mass extinction events, climate change, habitat loss, and other factors. Below are some notable extinction events and patterns within Tetrapoda:\n- **Permian-Triassic Extinction (252 million years ago)**: The largest mass extinction event in Earth's history wiped out many early tetrapod lineages, including many synapsids (mammal-like reptiles) and early reptiles. However, some lineages survived and gave rise to modern tetrapods.\n- **Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction (66 million years ago)**: This event, caused by an asteroid impact, led to the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs (a major tetrapod group). Birds, which are theropod dinosaurs, survived and diversified.\n- **Modern Extinctions**: Many tetrapod species, particularly amphibians, are currently facing extinction risks due to human activities, including habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and diseases like chytridiomycosis in amphibians. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), numerous tetrapod species are listed as endangered or critically endangered.\n\nIn summary, while Tetrapoda as a whole continues to thrive with millions of species, specific groups and species within it have gone extinct at various points in history, and many face ongoing threats today."

This group is significant in evolutionary biology because it includes the ancestors of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates, including amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals). Below is detailed information on the species distribution, when they first appeared, and their extinction status.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\n- **Historical Distribution**: Sarcopterygii originated in marine environments during the early Paleozoic Era and were widespread in both marine and freshwater habitats during the Devonian Period (approximately 419 to 359 million years ago), often referred to as the \"Age of Fishes.\" Fossil evidence shows their presence across various continents, indicating a global distribution during their peak.\n- **Current Distribution**: Today, the extant (living) members of Sarcopterygii are limited to a few species with a much more restricted distribution:\n  - **Lungfish (Dipnoi)**: There are six living species of lungfish, found in freshwater environments in Africa (4 species of the genus *Protopterus*), South America (1 species, *Lepidosiren paradoxa*), and Australia (1 species, *Neoceratodus forsteri*).\n  - **Coelacanths (Actinistia)**: There are two living species of coelacanths, both in the genus *Latimeria*. *Latimeria chalumnae* is found in the western Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa, particularly near the Comoros Islands, while *Latimeria menadoensis* is found in the waters near Sulawesi, Indonesia.\n\n### **When the Species First Appeared**\n- Sarcopterygii first appeared during the late Silurian Period, approximately 425 million years ago. The earliest known sarcopterygian fossils, such as those of *Guiyu oneiros* from China, date to this time. This species is considered one of the oldest known lobe-finned fish and provides evidence of the early diversification of bony fish (Osteichthyes) into ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) and lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii).\n- By the Devonian Period, Sarcopterygii had diversified significantly, with various lineages evolving, including early forms that would eventually give rise to tetrapods.\n\n### **Extinction Status and When Extinctions Occurred**\n- **Not Fully Extinct**: Sarcopterygii as a group is not extinct, as it includes living representatives (lungfish and coelacanths). However, many lineages within Sarcopterygii have gone extinct over geological time.\n- **Extinct Lineages**:\n  - Numerous families and genera of lobe-finned fish that flourished during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras became extinct. For example, many marine sarcopterygians disappeared during mass extinction events, such as the Late Devonian extinction (approximately 375\u2013360 million years ago), which severely impacted marine ecosystems.\n  - The majority of non-tetrapod sarcopterygians declined by the end of the Permian Period (approximately 252 million years ago) during the largest mass extinction event in Earth's history, the Permian-Triassic extinction.\n  - Coelacanths were thought to have gone extinct around 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous Period during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event (which also wiped out non-avian dinosaurs). However, their rediscovery in 1938 off the coast of South Africa (*Latimeria chalumnae*) revealed that they had survived in deep-sea environments.\n- **Tetrapod Evolution**: One major lineage of Sarcopterygii gave rise to tetrapods during the Devonian Period (around 375\u2013360 million years ago). While these early tetrapod ancestors are extinct, their descendants (modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) continue to thrive.\n\n### **Summary of Key Points**\n- **First Appearance**: Late Silurian, ~425 million years ago.\n- **Historical Peak**: Devonian Period, with global distribution in marine and freshwater environments.\n- **Current Status**: Not extinct; represented by six species of lungfish and two species of coelacanths, with limited geographic ranges in Africa, South America, Australia, and the Indian Ocean.\n- **Extinctions**: Many lineages went extinct during events like the Late Devonian and Permian-Triassic extinctions, with significant declines by the end of the Mesozoic Era for non-tetrapod forms.\n\nSarcopterygii remains a critical group for understanding vertebrate evolution, particularly the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life through the evolution of tetrapods.

They are primarily found in specific regions, such as the Indian Ocean (coelacanths) and freshwater environments in Africa, South America, and Australia (lungfish).\n\nBony fish have adapted to a wide range of ecological niches, with some species living in extreme conditions, such as deep-sea environments (e.g., anglerfish) or high-altitude lakes.\n\n### When the Species First Appeared\nOsteichthyes first appeared during the late Silurian period, approximately 420 million years ago. The earliest known bony fish fossils, such as *Guiyu oneiros* from China, date to this period. These early forms were small and likely lived in freshwater environments. Over time, bony fish diversified significantly during the Devonian period (often called the \"Age of Fishes\"), splitting into the ray-finned and lobe-finned lineages. The ray-finned fish, in particular, underwent massive diversification, leading to the wide variety of species we see today.\n\n### Extinction Status\nOsteichthyes as a group is **not extinct**; it is a thriving class of vertebrates with over 30,000 living species, making it the largest class of vertebrates in terms of species diversity. However, within this class, many individual species and lineages have gone extinct over geological time due to environmental changes, competition, or mass extinction events. For example:\n- Some early forms of bony fish from the Paleozoic era, such as certain placoderms (though not true Osteichthyes, they are related to early fish evolution), and other primitive bony fish lineages, became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event around 252 million years ago.\n- Specific modern species of bony fish are currently threatened or have gone extinct due to human activities such as overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. For instance, the Chinese paddlefish (*Psephurus gladius*), a freshwater species, was declared extinct in 2020 after not being sighted since 2003.\n\nIn summary, while the class Osteichthyes remains extant and highly diverse, many of its member species have faced extinction in the past, and some continue to be at risk today due to anthropogenic pressures. If you have a specific species or subgroup within Osteichthyes in mind, I can provide more detailed information on that."

        "ancestor": "Vertebrata",
        "info": "**Gnathostomata Overview**\n\nGnathostomata, commonly known as jawed vertebrates, is a major group of vertebrates that includes all animals with jaws. This group encompasses a vast diversity of species, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Gnathostomes are distinguished from their jawless counterparts, the Agnatha (like lampreys and hagfish), by the presence of hinged jaws, which allowed for more effective feeding and predation, contributing to their evolutionary success.\n\n### Species Distribution\nGnathostomata is a superclass within the phylum Chordata and is distributed globally across virtually every habitat on Earth, from deep oceans to terrestrial environments and the skies. The group includes:\n\n- **Chondrichthyes**: Cartilaginous fish such as sharks, rays, and skates, primarily found in marine environments, with some species in freshwater.\n- **Osteichthyes**: Bony fish, including ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) and lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii), found in both marine and freshwater environments worldwide.\n- **Amphibia**: Amphibians like frogs, toads, and salamanders, typically found in moist terrestrial and freshwater environments across most continents.\n- **Reptilia**: Reptiles, including snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, found in a wide range of terrestrial, aquatic, and semi-aquatic habitats globally.\n- **Aves**: Birds, which are found in nearly every terrestrial and coastal environment, from polar regions to tropical rainforests.\n- **Mammalia**: Mammals, including humans, found across all continents and oceans, adapted to a wide variety of environments, from deserts to polar ice caps.\n\nThere are over 60,000 described species of gnathostomes, making them one of the most diverse and widespread groups of animals on the planet.\n\n### When Gnathostomata First Appeared\nGnathostomata first appeared during the Late Silurian period, approximately 420\u2013430 million years ago. The earliest known jawed vertebrates are believed to be placoderms, an extinct group of armored fish. Fossils of early gnathostomes, such as *Entelognathus primordialis* (a placoderm-like fish from China dated to about 423 million years ago), provide evidence of the transition from jawless to jawed vertebrates. The development of jaws is thought to have evolved from modified gill arches, a key innovation that allowed for more efficient feeding and predation, leading to the rapid diversification of gnathostomes.\n\n### Extinction Status\nGnathostomata as a group is **not extinct** and remains a thriving and dominant clade of vertebrates today. However, many subgroups and individual species within Gnathostomata have gone extinct over geological time. For example:\n\n- **Placodermi**: The earliest jawed vertebrates, which flourished during the Silurian and Devonian periods (approximately 443\u2013358 million years ago), became extinct by the end of the Devonian period, around 358 million years ago, likely due to competition with other fish groups and environmental changes.\n- **Acanthodii**: Often called \"spiny sharks,\" this group of early jawed fish appeared in the Silurian and became extinct by the end of the Permian period, about 252 million years ago, possibly due to competition with more advanced bony and cartilaginous fish.\n- Numerous individual species within modern gnathostome groups (e.g., certain dinosaurs, marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs, and many mammal species) have also gone extinct due to mass extinction events, habitat loss, climate change, or human activity.\n\nCurrently, many living gnathostome species face the risk of extinction due to anthropogenic factors such as habitat destruction, overfishing, pollution, and climate change. For instance, many shark species (Chondrichthyes) and amphibians are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n### Summary\n- **Distribution**: Worldwide, in nearly every habitat, with over 60,000 species across fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.\n- **First Appearance**: Late Silurian, approximately 420\u2013430 million years ago.\n- **Extinction Status**: Not extinct as a group; thriving with many living species, though some subgroups (e.g., Placodermi, Acanthodii) and numerous individual species have gone extinct over time, with extinctions occurring at various points in geological history (e.g., end of Devonian for placoderms, Permian for acanthodians, and Cretaceous-Paleogene for non-avian dinosaurs around 66 million years ago).\n\nIf you would like more detailed information on a specific subgroup or species within Gnathostomata, feel free to ask!"

        "info": "**Vertebrata (Vertebrates)** is a subphylum of the phylum Chordata, encompassing animals with a backbone or spinal column. This group includes a wide range of species such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Below is detailed information on their distribution, evolutionary origin, and extinction status.\n\n### Species Distribution\nVertebrates are found across the globe, inhabiting virtually every type of environment, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and from polar regions to tropical rainforests. Their distribution includes:\n- **Marine environments**: Many fish species (e.g., sharks, bony fish) and marine reptiles (e.g., sea turtles) live in oceans and seas.\n- **Freshwater environments**: Fish (e.g., trout, catfish) and amphibians (e.g., frogs, salamanders) are common in rivers, lakes, and wetlands.\n- **Terrestrial environments**: Reptiles (e.g., snakes, lizards), birds (e.g., eagles, sparrows), and mammals (e.g., lions, humans) are widespread on land.\n- **Aerial environments**: Birds and some mammals (e.g., bats) dominate the skies.\n- **Polar and extreme environments**: Certain mammals (e.g., polar bears, penguins) and birds are adapted to cold climates.\n\nThe adaptability of vertebrates, through traits like endothermy (in birds and mammals) and diverse reproductive strategies, has allowed them to colonize a wide range of habitats.\n\n### When Vertebrates First Appeared\nVertebrates first appeared during the early Cambrian period, approximately **535\u2013525 million years ago (Mya)**, as part of the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid evolutionary diversification. The earliest known vertebrates are small, jawless fish-like creatures, such as *Myllokunmingia* and *Haikouichthys*, discovered in the Chengjiang fossil deposits of China. These early vertebrates lacked true bone but had a notochord (a precursor to the spine) and rudimentary vertebral structures.\n\nThe evolutionary timeline of major vertebrate groups is as follows:\n- **Jawless fish (Agnatha)**: Earliest vertebrates, appearing around 525 Mya.\n- **Jawed fish (Gnathostomes)**: Emerged around 450 Mya during the Ordovician period.\n- **Tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates)**: Evolved from lobe-finned fish around 390\u2013360 Mya during the Devonian period, leading to amphibians.\n- **Reptiles and early mammals**: Appeared in the Carboniferous and Permian periods (around 300 Mya).\n- **Birds**: Evolved from theropod dinosaurs around 150 Mya during the Jurassic period.\n\n### Extinction Status\nThe subphylum Vertebrata as a whole is **not extinct** and remains a thriving group with over 70,000 described species today. Vertebrates include some of the most dominant and diverse animals on Earth, such as humans, domesticated animals, and numerous wild species.\n\nHowever, within Vertebrata, many individual species and even entire groups have gone extinct over geological time due to mass extinction events, habitat changes, and other factors. Notable examples include:\n- **Extinct Groups**:\n  - **Trilobites and early jawless fish**: Many early vertebrate lineages, such as ostracoderms, became extinct by the end of the Devonian period (around 359 Mya).\n  - **Dinosaurs (non-avian)**: Most dinosaurs went extinct around 66 Mya during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, likely caused by an asteroid impact and volcanic activity. Birds, which are descendants of theropod dinosaurs, survived.\n  - **Marine reptiles**: Groups like ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs became extinct by the end of the Cretaceous (66 Mya).\n  - **Mammal-like reptiles (Synapsids)**: Many early synapsids, which were ancestors to mammals, went extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event (around 252 Mya), the largest mass extinction in Earth's history.\n- **Recent Extinctions**:\n  - Numerous vertebrate species have gone extinct in recent history due to human activity, including habitat destruction, hunting, and climate change. Examples include the dodo (extinct in the 17th century), the passenger pigeon (extinct in 1914), and the Tasmanian tiger (extinct in 1936).\n  - Currently, many vertebrate species are endangered or critically endangered, such as certain species of amphibians, fish, and large mammals (e.g., rhinoceros, tigers).\n\n### Summary\n- **Distribution**: Worldwide, in nearly all habitats.\n- **First Appearance**: Approximately 535\u2013525 Mya during the Cambrian period.\n- **Extinction Status**: Vertebrata as a group is not extinct; it includes many living species. However, numerous individual species and lineages within Vertebrata have gone extinct over time, with significant losses during mass extinction events and in recent centuries due to human impact.\n\nIf you would like specific details on a particular class or species within Vertebrata (e.g., mammals, dinosaurs, or a specific animal), please let me know!"

    "Chordata": {
        "ancestor": "Deuterostomia",
        "info": "Chordata is not a species but a phylum within the animal kingdom. It includes a wide variety of organisms that share certain key characteristics, such as a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail at some point in their life cycle. This phylum encompasses diverse groups, including vertebrates (like fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and some invertebrates (like tunicates and lancelets). Below, I will provide an overview of the phylum Chordata, including its distribution, evolutionary history, and status regarding extinction.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nChordates are found worldwide, across nearly every habitat on Earth, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and from polar regions to tropical environments. Their distribution varies depending on the specific group within the phylum:\n- **Vertebrates**: \n  - Fish (e.g., bony fish and cartilaginous fish) are primarily aquatic, inhabiting freshwater and marine environments globally.\n  - Amphibians are often found in moist environments, such as wetlands and forests, though some species live in arid regions.\n  - Reptiles, birds, and mammals are distributed across terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments, with adaptations to diverse climates (e.g., penguins in Antarctica, camels in deserts, and tropical birds in rainforests).\n- **Invertebrate Chordates**:\n  - Tunicates (sea squirts) are marine organisms found in oceans worldwide, often attached to rocks or other substrates.\n  - Lancelets (amphioxus) are small, fish-like marine animals found in shallow coastal waters, primarily in tropical and temperate regions.\n\n### **When Chordata First Appeared**\nThe phylum Chordata first appeared during the Cambrian Period, approximately 540 million years ago, as part of the Cambrian Explosion, a time of rapid diversification of life on Earth. The earliest known chordates were likely small, soft-bodied organisms similar to modern lancelets. One of the earliest fossil evidence of chordates comes from creatures like *Pikaia gracilens*, a small, eel-like organism found in the Burgess Shale (dated to about 508 million years ago). While *Pikaia* is not a direct ancestor of modern chordates, it exhibits characteristics such as a notochord, suggesting it is an early representative or close relative of the chordate lineage.\n\nOver time, chordates evolved into more complex forms, with the development of vertebrae in some lineages leading to the rise of vertebrates. Key milestones in chordate evolution include:\n- The appearance of jawless fish (agnathans) around 500 million years ago.\n- The evolution of jawed fish by the Silurian Period (about 420 million years ago).\n- The transition of vertebrates to land, with early tetrapods (ancestors of amphibians) appearing around 370 million years ago.\n\n### **Extinction Status**\nSince Chordata is a phylum and not a single species, it is not extinct. The phylum as a whole persists today with millions of living species, including humans. However, many individual species and groups within Chordata have gone extinct over geological time, often due to mass extinction events or environmental changes. Some notable examples of extinct chordate groups or species include:\n- **Trilobites and early jawless fish** (e.g., ostracoderms), which largely disappeared by the end of the Devonian Period (about 359 million years ago) during the Late Devonian extinction.\n- **Dinosaurs** (non-avian), which became extinct around 66 million years ago during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, likely caused by an asteroid impact and associated climate change. (Note: Birds are considered living descendants of theropod dinosaurs and are thus part of Chordata.)\n- **Numerous mammal species**, such as the woolly mammoth, which became extinct around 4,000 years ago due to climate change and human hunting pressures.\n\nMany modern chordate species are currently threatened or endangered due to habitat loss, climate change, pollution, and overexploitation. For example, numerous species of amphibians, fish, and mammals are at risk of extinction today, as documented by organizations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n### **Summary**\n- **Distribution**: Chordates are globally distributed across terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments.\n- **First Appearance**: The phylum Chordata originated around 540 million years ago during the Cambrian Period, with early representatives like *Pikaia*.\n- **Extinction**: The phylum itself is not extinct and includes a vast diversity of living species. However, many specific groups and species within Chordata have gone extinct at various points in history, with some modern species currently at risk.\n\nIf you meant a specific species or subgroup within Chordata (e.g., a particular fish, bird, or mammal), please clarify, and I can provide detailed information on that taxon."

    "Deuterostomia": {
        "ancestor": "Bilateria",
        "info": "Deuterostomia is not a single species but a major taxonomic group (superphylum) within the animal kingdom. It includes a diverse array of animals characterized by a specific pattern of embryonic development. In deuterostomes, the first opening formed during embryonic development (the blastopore) becomes the anus, while the mouth forms later as a secondary opening. This is in contrast to protostomes, where the blastopore becomes the mouth. Below, I will provide an overview of Deuterostomia, including its distribution, evolutionary origins, and status of its major groups.\n\n### Overview of Deuterostomia\nDeuterostomia includes several important phyla, such as:\n- **Echinodermata** (e.g., sea stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers)\n- **Chordata** (e.g., vertebrates like fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, as well as tunicates and lancelets)\n- **Hemichordata** (e.g., acorn worms and pterobranchs)\n\nSome classifications also include the phylum **Xenacoelomorpha** (small, simple marine worms), though its placement is debated and sometimes considered basal to deuterostomes or a separate lineage.\n\n### Distribution\nDeuterostomes are found worldwide across various ecosystems, primarily in marine environments, though many chordates (especially vertebrates) have adapted to terrestrial and freshwater habitats. Here's a breakdown by major groups:\n- **Echinodermata**: Exclusively marine, found in oceans from shallow coastal waters to deep-sea environments.\n- **Chordata**: Extremely widespread. Vertebrates inhabit marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments globally, while non-vertebrate chordates (tunicates and lancelets) are primarily marine.\n- **Hemichordata**: Mostly marine, found in shallow to deep ocean waters, often burrowing in sediment or living in colonies (pterobranchs).\n\n### Evolutionary Origins (When Deuterostomia First Appeared)\nDeuterostomes are an ancient group, with their origins tracing back to the early stages of animal evolution during the Ediacaran Period (approximately 635\u2013541 million years ago) or shortly after, in the Cambrian Period (541\u2013485 million years ago). The exact timing is difficult to pinpoint due to the scarcity of early fossil records for soft-bodied ancestors. However:\n- Molecular clock studies suggest that deuterostomes diverged from protostomes around 600\u2013550 million years ago.\n- The earliest unambiguous deuterostome fossils are from the Cambrian Period. For example:\n  - Echinoderm-like fossils appear in the early Cambrian (around 520 million years ago).\n  - Early chordate fossils, such as *Pikaia* (a possible early chordate), are found in the Burgess Shale, dating to about 508 million years ago.\n- Hemichordates also likely originated during the Cambrian, with fossil evidence of graptolites (related to pterobranchs) appearing around 490 million years ago.\n\nThe common ancestor of deuterostomes was likely a small, bilaterally symmetrical, marine organism with a simple body plan, possibly resembling modern acorn worms or early chordates.\n\n### Extinction Status\nDeuterostomia as a group is not extinct; it is a thriving lineage with millions of extant species, especially within the phylum Chordata (e.g., over 60,000 vertebrate species alone). However, within the deuterostome lineage, there have been extinctions of specific subgroups or species over geological time. Below are notes on extinction for major deuterostome groups:\n- **Echinodermata**: This group has experienced mass extinctions, particularly during major events like the Permian-Triassic extinction (about 252 million years ago), which wiped out many ancient echinoderm lineages. However, modern echinoderms (sea stars, urchins, etc.) persist with around 7,000 living species.\n- **Chordata**: While many chordate lineages, such as certain prehistoric fish, amphibians, reptiles (e.g., non-avian dinosaurs), and mammals, have gone extinct during mass extinction events (e.g., the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction 66 million years ago), the phylum as a whole is extremely diverse and successful today. Modern vertebrates and non-vertebrates (tunicates, lancelets) are not at risk of extinction as a group, though individual species face threats due to habitat loss, climate change, and other factors.\n- **Hemichordata**: This group has a limited fossil record, and some ancient lineages (e.g., certain graptolites) went extinct by the Carboniferous Period (around 300 million years ago). However, living hemichordates like acorn worms and pterobranchs still exist, though they are less diverse compared to other deuterostome groups.\n\n### Summary\n- **Distribution**: Deuterostomes are globally distributed, predominantly in marine environments, with chordates also occupying freshwater and terrestrial habitats.\n- **First Appearance**: Originated around 600\u2013550 million years ago, with fossil evidence from the Cambrian Period (around 520\u2013500 million years ago).\n- **Extinction Status**: Deuterostomia as a group is not extinct. While some lineages within deuterostome phyla have gone extinct during mass extinction events (e.g., certain echinoderms, graptolites, and non-avian dinosaurs), the superphylum remains highly diverse and includes millions of living species, particularly within Chordata.\n\nIf you meant a specific deuterostome species rather than the group as a whole, please clarify, and I can provide detailed information on that species!"

It includes all animals that exhibit bilateral symmetry, meaning their bodies can be divided into two mirror-image halves along a central axis. This group encompasses the vast majority of animal species, ranging from worms to humans. Below, I will provide information on the distribution, first appearance, and extinction status of Bilateria as a clade.\n\n### Species Distribution\nBilateria is a highly diverse group distributed across virtually all ecosystems on Earth, including terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. Members of Bilateria include:\n- **Protostomes**: Such as insects, mollusks, and annelids, which are found in nearly every habitat, from deep oceans to deserts.\n- **Deuterostomes**: Including echinoderms (like starfish) and chordates (such as fish, birds, and mammals), which are also widespread across marine and terrestrial environments.\nBilaterians are found on every continent and in every ocean, from polar regions to tropical zones, and from the deepest ocean trenches to the highest mountains.\n\n### First Appearance\nThe first Bilateria are believed to have appeared during the Ediacaran Period, approximately **635\u2013541 million years ago (Mya)**. Fossil evidence of early bilaterians is scarce due to their soft-bodied nature, but trace fossils (like burrows and tracks) and rare body fossils suggest their presence during this time. One of the earliest potential bilaterian fossils is *Kimberella*, a small, oval-shaped organism from the Ediacaran biota, dated to around 555 Mya, which some researchers interpret as an early mollusk-like bilaterian. Molecular clock studies also support an origin of Bilateria during the late Neoproterozoic Era, around 600\u2013700 Mya, before the Cambrian Explosion (541\u2013485 Mya), when bilaterian diversity dramatically increased with the appearance of most major animal phyla.\n\n### Extinction Status\nBilateria as a clade is **not extinct** and remains one of the most successful groups of organisms on Earth. It includes an estimated 1.5 million described species and likely millions more that are undescribed. While many individual bilaterian species and lineages have gone extinct over geological time (e.g., trilobites, which went extinct during the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event around 252 Mya), the clade as a whole continues to thrive. Extinct bilaterian groups are often studied through the fossil record, but living representatives include humans, insects, fish, and countless other animals.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Evolutionary Significance**: Bilateral symmetry is associated with the development of a head (cephalization), a central nervous system, and directional movement, which likely contributed to the evolutionary success of Bilateria.\n- **Major Subgroups**: Bilateria is divided into two main lineages based on embryonic development: Protostomia (e.g., arthropods, mollusks) and Deuterostomia (e.g., vertebrates, echinoderms).\n- **Mass Extinctions**: Bilaterians have survived all five major mass extinction events in Earth's history, though specific groups were heavily impacted. For instance, the Permian-Triassic extinction wiped out up to 96% of marine species, many of which were bilaterians.\n\nIf you meant a specific species within Bilateria, please clarify, and I can provide detailed information on that organism."

        "info": "**Eumetazoa Overview**\n\nEumetazoa is a major clade of animals that encompasses all animals with true tissues, including most of the familiar animal groups such as cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, sea anemones), ctenophores (comb jellies, though their placement is sometimes debated), and bilaterians (which include insects, mammals, birds, fish, and more). Eumetazoans are characterized by the presence of specialized tissues like nervous and muscle tissues, as well as a defined body plan with symmetry (radial or bilateral). They are distinct from the more basal Parazoa (sponges), which lack true tissues.\n\nBelow is detailed information on the distribution, first appearance, and extinction status of Eumetazoa as a group:\n\n### 1. **Species Distribution**\n- **Geographic Distribution**: Eumetazoans are found worldwide across virtually all ecosystems, from marine environments (oceans, coral reefs) to freshwater systems (lakes, rivers) and terrestrial habitats (forests, deserts, tundra). Their distribution reflects the incredible diversity of the group, which includes aquatic animals like jellyfish and fish, as well as terrestrial animals like insects, birds, and mammals.\n- **Habitat Range**: Eumetazoans inhabit a wide range of ecological niches, from the deep sea (e.g., deep-sea fish, cephalopods) to high altitudes (e.g., birds, mountain goats), and from polar regions (e.g., penguins, polar bears) to tropical rainforests (e.g., frogs, monkeys).\n\n### 2. **First Appearance**\n- **Time of Origin**: Eumetazoa likely first appeared during the late Ediacaran period, approximately **635\u2013541 million years ago (Mya)**, based on fossil evidence and molecular clock estimates. Some of the earliest evidence of eumetazoan-like organisms comes from the Ediacaran biota, though the exact nature of these organisms (e.g., whether they are true eumetazoans or precursors) remains debated.\n- **Fossil Evidence**: The oldest widely accepted eumetazoan fossils are from the Cambrian period (starting around 541 Mya), during the \"Cambrian Explosion,\" when many major animal phyla, including early cnidarians and bilaterians, rapidly diversified. Trace fossils and small shelly fossils from this time suggest complex animal behaviors and structures consistent with eumetazoan characteristics.\n- **Molecular Evidence**: Molecular phylogenies suggest that the split between Eumetazoa and more basal groups (like sponges) may have occurred even earlier, possibly around 700\u2013800 Mya, though direct fossil evidence from this time is scarce.\n\n### 3. **Extinction Status**\n- **Is Eumetazoa Extinct?**: No, Eumetazoa as a clade is not extinct. It is a thriving group that includes the vast majority of living animals today, from simple organisms like jellyfish to complex organisms like humans.\n- **Extinction of Specific Lineages**: While Eumetazoa as a whole persists, many specific lineages within the group have gone extinct over geological time. Examples include:\n  - **Trilobites** (extinct arthropods from the Paleozoic era, last appearing around 252 Mya during the Permian-Triassic mass extinction).\n  - **Ammonites** (extinct cephalopods, which disappeared around 66 Mya during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event alongside the dinosaurs).\n  - Various other extinct groups like graptolites, eurypterids (sea scorpions), and numerous prehistoric reptiles, mammals, and fish.\n- **Mass Extinction Events**: Eumetazoans have survived and adapted through multiple mass extinction events (e.g., the Permian-Triassic extinction ~252 Mya, the most severe, wiping out ~90% of species, and the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction ~66 Mya). Each event led to the loss of many eumetazoan lineages but also paved the way for diversification of surviving groups.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Diversity**: Eumetazoa includes over 1.5 million described species today, with potentially millions more undiscovered, especially among insects and marine invertebrates.\n- **Evolutionary Significance**: The emergence of Eumetazoa marked a critical step in the evolution of complex multicellular life, leading to the development of specialized tissues, organ systems, and diverse body plans.\n- **Phylogenetic Debate**: The exact relationship between major eumetazoan groups, such as the placement of ctenophores (comb jellies) as either the sister group to all other eumetazoans or closely related to cnidarians, remains a topic of active research.\n\nIf you would like more specific information on a particular eumetazoan subgroup (e.g., Cnidaria, Arthropoda, Chordata) or extinct lineage, please let me know!"

This group encompasses a vast diversity of life forms, ranging from simple sponges to complex vertebrates like mammals, birds, and reptiles. Metazoans are characterized by their multicellularity, heterotrophic mode of nutrition (they obtain energy by consuming other organisms), and the presence of specialized tissues and organs in most species.\n\nBelow is detailed information on the distribution, origin, and extinction status of Metazoa as a group. Since Metazoa is not a single species but a broad taxonomic group, I will address these aspects at a general level for the clade.\n\n---\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nMetazoans are found in virtually every habitat on Earth, from the deepest ocean trenches to the highest mountain peaks, and from polar ice caps to tropical rainforests. Their distribution includes:\n- **Marine Environments**: The majority of animal diversity is found in oceans, including corals, fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and marine mammals. Many metazoan phyla, such as Porifera (sponges) and Cnidaria (jellyfish, corals), are predominantly or exclusively marine.\n- **Freshwater Environments**: Rivers, lakes, and wetlands host a variety of metazoans, including fish, amphibians, insects, and crustaceans like crayfish.\n- **Terrestrial Environments**: Land-based habitats are dominated by insects, arachnids, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Terrestrial metazoans have adapted to a wide range of climates and ecosystems, such as deserts, grasslands, and forests.\n- **Aerial Environments**: Many birds, bats, and insects are adapted for flight, occupying aerial niches.\n- **Subterranean Environments**: Some metazoans, such as moles, worms, and certain insects, live underground.\n- **Parasitic and Symbiotic Niches**: Numerous metazoans, including flatworms, roundworms, and certain arthropods, live as parasites or symbionts within or on other organisms.\n\nThe distribution of specific metazoan groups depends on their evolutionary adaptations to environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and food availability.\n\n---\n\n### **When Metazoa First Appeared**\nThe origin of Metazoa marks a significant milestone in the history of life on Earth, representing the transition from single-celled to multicellular organisms. The exact timing of their emergence is still a subject of research and debate, but evidence from the fossil record, molecular clocks, and genetic studies provides a general timeline:\n- **Earliest Evidence**: The first definitive evidence of metazoans comes from the late Ediacaran period, approximately 635\u2013541 million years ago (Mya). Fossils from this period, known as the Ediacaran biota, include soft-bodied organisms that may represent early animals or their relatives. Examples include *Dickinsonia* and *Spriggina*, though their exact relationship to modern animals is debated.\n- **Molecular Clock Estimates**: Genetic studies suggest that the common ancestor of all living metazoans may have emerged earlier, potentially around 800\u20131,000 Mya, during the Cryogenian period. However, there is no direct fossil evidence from this time, possibly due to the lack of hard body parts in early metazoans.\n- **Cambrian Explosion**: By the early Cambrian period (around 541 Mya), there was a rapid diversification of metazoan life, often referred to as the \"Cambrian Explosion.\" During this time, most major animal phyla appeared in the fossil record, including arthropods, mollusks, and early chordates.\n\nThe transition to multicellularity likely involved the development of cell specialization and communication, enabling the formation of tissues and organs. Early metazoans were likely simple, sponge-like organisms, with more complex body plans evolving over time.\n\n---\n\n### **Extinction Status: Is Metazoa Extinct?**\nMetazoa as a group is **not extinct**; it is a thriving clade that includes all living animals. There are over 1.5 million described species of animals today, and estimates suggest that many more remain undiscovered, particularly in understudied habitats like deep oceans and tropical rainforests.\n\nHowever, within the Metazoa, many individual species and even higher taxonomic groups (e.g., certain orders or families) have gone extinct over geological time. Major extinction events have significantly impacted metazoan diversity:\n- **End-Ordovician Extinction (ca. 445 Mya)**: Caused by climate change and sea level fluctuations, this event led to the loss of many marine species.\n- **Late Devonian Extinction (ca. 375\u2013360 Mya)**: This event affected marine life, particularly reef-building organisms and early fish.\n- **Permian-Triassic Extinction (ca. 252 Mya)**: The largest mass extinction in Earth's history, often called the \"Great Dying,\" wiped out approximately 90\u201396% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species. Many metazoan groups, such as trilobites, disappeared or were severely reduced.\n- **Triassic-Jurassic Extinction (ca. 201 Mya)**: This event affected early reptiles and amphibians, paving the way for the dominance of dinosaurs.\n- **Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction (ca. 66 Mya)**: Best known for the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, this event was likely caused by an asteroid impact and led to the loss of many metazoan groups, though mammals and birds survived and diversified.\n\nCurrently, many metazoan species are facing extinction due to human activities, including habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and overexploitation. This ongoing biodiversity crisis is sometimes referred to as the \"Sixth Mass Extinction,\" with species such as amphibians, coral reefs, and large mammals being particularly vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- **Distribution**: Metazoans are globally distributed across marine, freshwater, terrestrial, aerial, and subterranean habitats, with adaptations to nearly every environment on Earth.\n- **First Appearance**: The earliest evidence of Metazoa dates to the Ediacaran period (ca. 635\u2013541 Mya), with molecular evidence suggesting an origin as early as 800\u20131,000 Mya. Major diversification occurred during the Cambrian Explosion (ca. 541 Mya).\n- **Extinction Status**: Metazoa as a group is not extinct and includes all living animals. However, numerous individual species and subgroups have gone extinct during past mass extinction events, and many are currently threatened by human-induced environmental changes.\n\nIf you would like more specific information about a particular metazoan subgroup (e.g., a specific phylum, class, or species), please let me know!"

    "Choanoflagellates": {
        "info": "**Choanoflagellates: Overview and Key Information**\n\nChoanoflagellates are a group of free-living, single-celled or colonial protists that belong to the phylum Choanozoa. They are of significant interest to evolutionary biologists because they are considered the closest living relatives to animals (Metazoa), sharing a common ancestor that likely gave rise to multicellular animals. Below is detailed information on their distribution, evolutionary history, and extinction status.\n\n### Species Distribution\nChoanoflagellates are widely distributed across aquatic environments, both marine and freshwater, and can be found in various habitats globally. Their distribution includes:\n- **Marine Environments**: They are commonly found in seawater, from coastal regions to the open ocean, often in the water column or associated with sediments.\n- **Freshwater Environments**: Some species inhabit lakes, rivers, and ponds.\n- **Other Habitats**: Choanoflagellates can also be found in brackish water and even in moist terrestrial environments, such as soil, though they are predominantly aquatic.\n- They are often free-floating (planktonic) or attached to substrates like rocks, algae, or detritus. Their distribution is influenced by factors such as water temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability.\n\nChoanoflagellates are cosmopolitan, meaning they are found in aquatic ecosystems worldwide, from polar to tropical regions. Specific species may have more restricted ranges depending on environmental preferences.\n\n### When Choanoflagellates First Appeared\nChoanoflagellates are ancient organisms with origins dating back to the Proterozoic Eon, likely over 1 billion years ago. While direct fossil evidence of choanoflagellates is scarce due to their small size and lack of hard parts, molecular clock analyses and phylogenetic studies provide insight into their evolutionary timeline:\n- **Estimated Origin**: Molecular data suggest that choanoflagellates diverged from their common ancestor with animals (Metazoa) around 1,000 to 1,200 million years ago (Mya) during the Neoproterozoic Era.\n- **Fossil Evidence**: The earliest indirect evidence of choanoflagellate-like organisms comes from microfossils and biomarkers dating to the Neoproterozoic (around 1,000\u2013541 Mya). However, definitive fossils are rare because their delicate structures (like the siliceous lorica of some species) are not always preserved.\n\nTheir evolutionary history indicates that choanoflagellates were present well before the Cambrian Explosion (around 541 Mya), when animal diversity rapidly increased.\n\n### Extinction Status\nChoanoflagellates as a group are **not extinct**; they are extant and thriving in modern ecosystems. They continue to play important ecological roles, such as acting as bacterivores (feeding on bacteria) and contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic food webs.\n- **Individual Species Extinction**: While the group as a whole persists, it is likely that many individual choanoflagellate species have gone extinct over their long evolutionary history due to environmental changes, competition, or other factors. However, specific extinction events for particular species are not well-documented due to the challenges in studying protist fossils.\n- **Modern Status**: There are over 125 described species of choanoflagellates today, and they remain a vital part of microbial communities in aquatic environments. They are not considered at risk of extinction as a group, though local populations may be affected by pollution, climate change, or habitat destruction.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Morphology and Behavior**: Choanoflagellates are characterized by a single flagellum surrounded by a collar of microvilli, which they use to capture bacterial prey. Some species form colonies, which are of particular interest as models for understanding the evolution of multicellularity in animals.\n- **Evolutionary Significance**: Their close relationship to animals makes them a key group for studying the transition from single-celled to multicellular life. Genetic and molecular studies of choanoflagellates have revealed genes and signaling pathways shared with animals, shedding light on early animal evolution.\n\nIf you have a specific choanoflagellate species in mind or would like more detailed information on a particular aspect (e.g., specific genera like *Monosiga* or *Salpingoeca*), please let me know!"

        "ancestor": "Ornithorhynchus",
        "info": "**Ornithorhynchus anatinus**, commonly known as the **platypus**, is a unique egg-laying mammal native to eastern Australia and Tasmania. Below is detailed information on its species distribution, evolutionary history, and current status regarding extinction.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\n- **Geographic Range**: The platypus is found in freshwater rivers, streams, and lakes across eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and parts of South Australia. It is also present in Tasmania and on King Island in the Bass Strait. Its distribution is largely confined to areas with suitable aquatic habitats, such as slow-moving rivers with vegetated banks for burrowing.\n- **Habitat**: Platypuses inhabit freshwater environments, preferring areas with submerged logs, roots, and overhanging vegetation where they can forage for food (mainly aquatic invertebrates like insect larvae, crustaceans, and small fish). They construct burrows in riverbanks for shelter and breeding.\n\n### **When the Species First Appeared**\n- **Evolutionary History**: The platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae within the order Monotremata, a primitive group of egg-laying mammals that diverged from other mammals around 166\u2013180 million years ago during the Jurassic period. Fossil evidence suggests that early monotremes, ancestors of the modern platypus, appeared around 110 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous period.\n- **Fossil Record of Platypus**: The oldest known fossil directly related to the modern platypus, *Obdurodon dicksoni*, dates back to about 15\u201325 million years ago in the Oligocene to Miocene epochs. Fossils of other related species, such as *Steropodon galmani* (from about 110 million years ago), indicate that monotremes have a long evolutionary history in Australia. The modern species, *Ornithorhynchus anatinus*, likely emerged more recently, though exact dates are uncertain due to limited fossil records.\n\n### **Extinction Status**\n- **Is the Species Extinct?**: No, the platypus is not extinct. It is still extant and survives in the wild, though its population is declining in certain areas.\n- **Conservation Status**: The platypus is currently classified as **Near Threatened** by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). While it is not extinct, it faces significant threats due to habitat loss, pollution, climate change, river regulation (dams and water extraction), and predation by introduced species like foxes. Additionally, extreme weather events such as droughts and bushfires (e.g., the 2019\u20132020 Australian wildfires) have further impacted local populations.\n- **Population Trends**: Historically, the platypus was more widespread, with evidence of its presence in parts of South Australia where it is now locally extinct (e.g., the Murray-Darling Basin). Efforts are ongoing to monitor and protect remaining populations through habitat restoration and conservation programs.\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n- The platypus is one of only five extant species of monotremes, alongside four species of echidnas. It is a remarkable example of evolutionary divergence, exhibiting a mix of mammalian, reptilian, and avian traits (e.g., fur, milk production, egg-laying, and a bill-like snout).\n- Its unique biology and restricted distribution make it an important species for studying mammalian evolution and for conservation efforts in Australia.\n\nIf you have further questions or would like more specific details about the platypus, feel free to ask!"

        "ancestor": "Monotremata",
        "info": "Ornithorhynchidae is a family of monotremes, which are egg-laying mammals, and it includes the modern platypus and its extinct relatives. The most well-known and only living member of this family is the platypus (*Ornithorhynchus anatinus*). Below is detailed information about the family Ornithorhynchidae, including species distribution, when the species first appeared, and information on extinction for relevant members.\n\n### Overview of Ornithorhynchidae\n- **Classification**: Ornithorhynchidae belongs to the order Monotremata, which also includes the family Zaglossidae (echidnas). Monotremes are unique among mammals for laying eggs rather than giving birth to live young.\n- **Living Species**: The family currently has only one extant species, the platypus (*Ornithorhynchus anatinus*).\n- **Fossil Record**: Several extinct species within Ornithorhynchidae have been identified through fossil evidence, providing insight into the evolutionary history of this family.\n\n### Species Distribution\n- **Modern Platypus (*Ornithorhynchus anatinus*)**:\n  - **Geographic Range**: The platypus is endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. It is found in freshwater rivers, streams, and lakes across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania.\n  - **Habitat**: Prefers cool, clear water bodies with abundant vegetation and suitable burrowing sites along riverbanks for nesting and resting.\n- **Extinct Species**: Fossil evidence suggests that relatives of the modern platypus once had a broader distribution, including parts of South America (based on related monotreme fossils) and possibly other regions of Gondwana during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. However, most fossil records of Ornithorhynchidae are from Australia.\n\n### When the Species First Appeared\n- **Evolutionary Origin**: The family Ornithorhynchidae is believed to have diverged from other monotremes around 110\u2013130 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous period, based on molecular and fossil evidence. Monotremes as a group are among the earliest diverging lineages of mammals.\n- **Earliest Fossil Evidence**: The oldest known fossils related to Ornithorhynchidae date back to the Cretaceous period in Australia. For instance:\n  - *Steropodon galmani*, a possible early relative or basal monotreme, dates to around 110 million years ago (Early Cretaceous) and was found in Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia. While not definitively classified as Ornithorhynchidae, it provides evidence of early monotreme diversity.\n  - More definitive fossils of Ornithorhynchidae, such as *Teinolophos trusleri* (also from the Early Cretaceous, about 123 million years ago), suggest the presence of platypus-like ancestors in Australia.\n- **Modern Platypus Lineage**: Fossils resembling the modern platypus (*Ornithorhynchus anatinus*) appear in the fossil record during the Miocene epoch, around 15\u201320 million years ago, though the lineage likely existed earlier.\n\n### Extinct Species and When They Became Extinct\nSeveral extinct species or genera within Ornithorhynchidae or closely related to it have been identified through fossils.

        "info": "Monotremata is an order of mammals that includes some of the most primitive and unique mammals on Earth. They are egg-laying mammals, a trait that distinguishes them from other mammals, which are typically placental or marsupial. The order Monotremata includes two extant families: **Ornithorhynchidae** (the platypus) and **Zaglossidae** (the echidnas or spiny anteaters). Below is detailed information on the species within this order, their distribution, evolutionary history, and extinction status of related species.\n\n### **Species Distribution (Extant Species)**\nMonotremes are found only in Australia and New Guinea, reflecting their ancient Gondwanan origins. The extant species are:\n1. **Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus)** - Family: Ornithorhynchidae\n   - **Distribution**: Eastern Australia, including Tasmania. They inhabit freshwater rivers, streams, and lakes.\n2. **Short-beaked Echidna (Zaglossus aculeatus)** - Family: Zaglossidae\n   - **Distribution**: Found throughout Australia, including Tasmania, and in parts of New Guinea. They inhabit a variety of environments, from forests to grasslands and deserts.\n3. **Sir David's Long-beaked Echidna (Zaglossus attenboroughi)** - Family: Zaglossidae\n   - **Distribution**: Restricted to the Cyclops Mountains in Papua, Indonesia (New Guinea). Critically endangered and poorly studied.\n4. **Eastern Long-beaked Echidna (Zaglossus bartoni)** - Family: Zaglossidae\n   - **Distribution**: Found in the highlands of New Guinea (both Papua New Guinea and Indonesian Papua). Also critically endangered.\n5. **Western Long-beaked Echidna (Zaglossus bruijnii)** - Family: Zaglossidae\n   - **Distribution**: Restricted to the Vogelkop Peninsula and nearby areas in West Papua, Indonesia (New Guinea). Critically endangered.\n\n### **When Monotremata First Appeared**\nMonotremes are considered one of the most ancient groups of mammals, with origins tracing back to the early Mesozoic Era. The earliest known monotreme fossils date to the Early Cretaceous period, approximately **110\u2013120 million years ago (mya)**. A notable early fossil is **Teinolophos trusleri**, discovered in Australia, which dates to about 123 mya and is considered an early monotreme or a close relative. This suggests that monotremes diverged from other mammals very early in mammalian evolution, likely before the split between marsupials and placental mammals.\n\nMolecular studies also support an ancient divergence, estimating that monotremes split from other mammals around **166\u2013220 mya**, during the Jurassic period. Their egg-laying reproductive strategy and unique anatomical features (e.g., lack of nipples, presence of a cloaca) are considered primitive traits retained from early mammal ancestors.\n\n### **Extinct Monotreme Species and When They Became Extinct**\nWhile only five species of monotremes survive today, the fossil record indicates that the group was more diverse in the past. Many extinct monotreme species are known from Australia, and their extinction is often linked to environmental changes, human arrival, and possibly competition with other mammals. Below are some notable extinct species and approximate extinction timelines:\n\n1. **Steropodon galmani**\n   - **Description**: One of the earliest known monotremes, represented by a jawbone fossil with teeth similar to those of the modern platypus.\n   - **Time Period**: Early Cretaceous, around 110 mya (lived, not extinct at this time).\n   - **Extinction**: Unknown, as it is only known from fossils of this age; likely evolved into or was replaced by later forms.\n\n2. **Kollikodon ritchiei**\n   - **Description**: An extinct monotreme known from a partial jawbone, likely adapted for crushing hard food like shellfish.\n   - **Time Period**: Early Cretaceous, around 100\u2013110 mya.\n   - **Extinction**: Unknown, but no fossils are found after this period.\n\n3. **Obdurodon dicksoni**\n   - **Description**: An extinct relative of the modern platypus, larger in size and with more robust teeth.\n   - **Time Period**: Miocene, around 15\u201325 mya.\n   - **Extinction**: Likely became extinct during the late Miocene or Pliocene (exact date unclear), possibly due to climate drying in Australia reducing freshwater habitats.\n\n4. **Zaglossus hacketti**\n   - **Description**: A giant echidna species, much larger than modern echidnas, known from fossils in Western Australia.\n   - **Time Period**: Pleistocene, up to around 40,000\u201350,000 years ago.\n   - **Extinction**: Likely became extinct during the late Pleistocene, possibly due to human arrival in Australia (around 50,000\u201360,000 years ago) and associated environmental changes or hunting pressure.\n\n5. **Zaglossus robustus**\n   - **Description**: Another large extinct echidna species from New Guinea.\n   - **Time Period**: Pleistocene to possibly early Holocene.\n   - **Extinction**: May have survived until a few thousand years ago, with evidence suggesting extinction after human settlement in New Guinea, likely due to hunting and habitat alteration.\n\n### **Summary of Extinction Status**\n- **Extant Species**: Only five monotreme species survive today (1 platypus and 4 echidnas). The long-beaked echidnas are critically endangered due to habitat loss and hunting.\n- **Extinct Species**: Several monotreme species and genera have gone extinct over millions of years, with more recent extinctions (e.g., giant echidnas) occurring in the late Pleistocene or early Holocene, often linked to human activity and climate change.\n\nMonotremes are a fascinating group, representing a living link to the early evolution of mammals. Their limited distribution and the endangered status of some species highlight the importance of conservation efforts to protect these unique animals.

There is only one extant (living) species within this genus: *Vombatus ursinus*, commonly known as the common wombat or coarse-haired wombat. Below is detailed information about the genus *Vombatus*, focusing on the living species, its distribution, evolutionary history, and extinction status of related species.\n\n### Species Distribution\n- **Current Distribution**: The common wombat (*Vombatus ursinus*) is endemic to southeastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. They inhabit a variety of environments, such as grasslands, woodlands, and mountainous regions, where they can dig burrows in well-drained soils. Their distribution has become fragmented due to habitat loss and competition with introduced species.\n- **Historical Distribution**: Fossil evidence suggests that wombats, including extinct species of the genus *Vombatus* and related genera, were once more widespread across Australia.\n\n### When the Species First Appeared\n- **Evolutionary History**: The genus *Vombatus* belongs to the family Vombatidae, which includes wombats and their extinct relatives. Fossil records indicate that the family Vombatidae dates back to the late Oligocene or early Miocene, approximately 25\u201320 million years ago. However, the modern genus *Vombatus* likely diverged more recently.\n- **First Appearance of *Vombatus ursinus***: The exact timeline for the emergence of the modern common wombat is not precisely documented, but it is believed to have appeared during the Pleistocene epoch (around 2.5 million to 11,700 years ago), based on fossil evidence. Wombats as a group evolved adaptations for burrowing and grazing during this period.\n\n### Extinction Status\n- **Current Status of *Vombatus ursinus***: The common wombat is not extinct and is classified as a species of \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though some populations are threatened by habitat destruction, road accidents, and diseases like sarcoptic mange caused by introduced mites.\n- **Extinct Related Species**: While *Vombatus ursinus* is the only living species in the genus, there are extinct species and genera within the family Vombatidae. For example:\n  - *Vombatus hacketti*: An extinct species of wombat that lived during the Pleistocene in southwestern Australia. It became extinct around 40,000\u201330,000 years ago, likely due to climate change and human activity following the arrival of Aboriginal Australians.\n  - Other extinct relatives, such as *Phascolonus* and *Ramsayia*, were larger than modern wombats and roamed Australia during the Pleistocene. These species also went extinct during the late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions, around 50,000\u201340,000 years ago, likely due to a combination of climatic shifts and human hunting or habitat alteration.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Wombats are unique marsupials known for their burrowing behavior and cube-shaped feces, which help mark territory. They are closely related to koalas, sharing a common ancestor within the order Diprotodontia.\n- The common wombat (*Vombatus ursinus*) has three recognized subspecies:\n  - *Vombatus ursinus ursinus* (mainland southeastern Australia)\n  - *Vombatus ursinus hirsutus* (Flinders Island, Tasmania)\n  - *Vombatus ursinus tasmaniensis* (Tasmania)\n- Conservation efforts are in place to protect the common wombat from ongoing threats like habitat loss and disease.\n\nIf you meant a different species or genus related to *Vombatus*, or if you would like more detailed information on a specific aspect (e.g., fossils, behavior, or conservation), please clarify!"

They inhabit semi-arid grasslands and scrublands.\n   - **Status**: Near Threatened (IUCN Red List), with population declines due to habitat destruction, drought, and competition with livestock.\n\n### Evolutionary History and First Appearance\n- **Origins**: The family Vombatidae is believed to have diverged from other marsupial lineages during the late Oligocene to early Miocene, approximately 25\u201330 million years ago. Fossil evidence suggests that early wombats were more diverse and widespread than modern species.\n- **Earliest Known Fossils**: The oldest known vombatid fossils date back to the late Oligocene (about 25 million years ago) in Australia. These early forms were smaller and less specialized for burrowing compared to modern wombats.\n- **Diversification**: During the Miocene and Pliocene (23\u20132.5 million years ago), wombats diversified into several genera and species, some of which were much larger than extant species. This period saw the emergence of giant wombats, such as *Diprotodon*, though it belongs to a related family (Diprotodontidae), and other large vombatids like *Phascolonus*.\n\n### Extinct Species and Genera of Vombatidae\nSeveral species and genera of wombats have gone extinct, particularly during the late Pleistocene as part of the megafaunal extinction event in Australia, likely driven by climate change and human activity.\n\n1. **Phascolonus gigas**  \n   - **Description**: A giant wombat, much larger than modern species, weighing up to 200 kg (440 lbs). It had a more robust build and likely lived in open grasslands.\n   - **Distribution**: Found across much of Australia during the Pleistocene.\n   - **Extinction**: Became extinct around 40,000\u201350,000 years ago, coinciding with the arrival of humans in Australia and significant climate shifts.\n\n2. **Ramsayia magna**  \n   - **Description**: Another extinct vombatid, smaller than *Phascolonus* but still larger than modern wombats.\n   - **Distribution**: Fossils have been found in eastern Australia.\n   - **Extinction**: Disappeared during the late Pleistocene, likely due to similar environmental and anthropogenic pressures.\n\n3. **Warendja wakefieldi**  \n   - **Description**: A smaller extinct wombat species, known from fossil remains.\n   - **Distribution**: Found in South Australia.\n   - **Extinction**: Extinct by the late Pleistocene, around 40,000 years ago.\n\n### Causes of Extinction for Prehistoric Vombatids\n- **Climate Change**: During the late Pleistocene, Australia experienced significant drying and cooling, which altered habitats and reduced food availability for large herbivores like giant wombats.\n- **Human Impact**: The arrival of Aboriginal peoples around 50,000\u201360,000 years ago likely contributed to megafaunal extinctions through hunting and the use of fire to manage landscapes, which altered ecosystems.\n- **Competition and Predation**: The introduction of competitors (like large kangaroos) and predators (like the now-extinct thylacine in some regions) may have also played a role in the decline of some species.\n\n### Summary\n- **Living Species**: Three extant species of wombats remain, all native to Australia: the Common Wombat (*Vombatus ursinus*), Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat (*Lasiorhinus krefftii*), and Southern Hairy-Nosed Wombat (*Lasiorhinus latifrons*). Their distributions are limited to specific regions of Australia, and two of the three face significant conservation challenges.\n- **First Appearance**: The family Vombatidae emerged around 25\u201330 million years ago during the late Oligocene to early Miocene.\n- **Extinct Species**: Several genera and species, including giant wombats like *Phascolonus gigas*, went extinct during the late Pleistocene (approximately 40,000\u201350,000 years ago), likely due to a combination of climate change and human activity.\n\nIf you would like more specific details on a particular species or aspect of wombat evolution, please let me know!"

        "ancestor": "Ailuropoda",
        "info": "**Ailuropoda melanoleuca** is the scientific name for the **giant panda**, a bear species native to China. Below is detailed information on the species' distribution, first appearance, and conservation status regarding extinction.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\n- **Current Range**: The giant panda is endemic to south-central China, primarily found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. Their habitat consists of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests with dense bamboo undergrowth, at elevations typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters (4,900\u20139,800 feet).\n- **Habitat Fragmentation**: Due to human activity, such as deforestation and agricultural expansion, their range has significantly decreased over time. Today, pandas live in fragmented habitats, with populations isolated in about 20 separate patches of bamboo forest.\n- **Conservation Efforts**: Many of these areas are now protected as nature reserves, such as the Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan, to preserve their habitat.\n\n### **When the Species First Appeared**\n- **Evolutionary History**: The giant panda belongs to the family Ursidae (bears) and diverged from other bear species approximately **19 million years ago**, based on fossil and genetic evidence. The earliest known ancestor of the giant panda is **Ailurarctos lufengensis**, a smaller, more primitive bear-like animal from the late Miocene epoch, whose fossils were found in China dating back about 8 million years.\n- **Modern Giant Panda**: Fossils of the modern giant panda, *Ailuropoda melanoleuca*, date back to the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene, approximately **2-3 million years ago**. These fossils indicate that pandas were once more widespread across southern and eastern China, as well as parts of Southeast Asia, including Myanmar and Vietnam.\n\n### **Extinction Status**\n- **Is the Species Extinct?**: No, the giant panda is **not extinct**. However, it is classified as **Vulnerable** on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species (as of the latest assessments). This is an improvement from its previous status of **Endangered**, thanks to successful conservation efforts.\n- **Historical Threats**: The giant panda faced severe population declines due to habitat loss, poaching, and low reproductive rates. By the late 20th century, their numbers were critically low, with estimates of fewer than 1,000 individuals in the wild.\n- **Current Population**: As of recent estimates, there are approximately **1,800 giant pandas** in the wild, largely due to conservation programs, habitat restoration, anti-poaching measures, and breeding programs in captivity. Additionally, pandas have been reintroduced into the wild from captivity with some success.\n- **Ongoing Challenges**: Despite progress, the species remains at risk due to habitat fragmentation, climate change (which affects bamboo availability, their primary food source), and the need for continued human intervention to maintain population stability.\n\n### **Summary**\nThe giant panda (*Ailuropoda melanoleuca*) is a unique and iconic species that first appeared in the fossil record around 2-3 million years ago, with ancestral roots dating back further. Once widespread across southern and eastern China, its current distribution is limited to isolated mountain ranges in south-central China. While it is not extinct, it remains vulnerable, with conservation efforts playing a critical role in its survival. There is no record of extinction for this species, as it continues to exist, albeit with a reduced and fragmented range."

    "Ailuropoda": {
        "ancestor": "Ursidae",
        "info": "The genus *Ailuropoda* refers to the group of bears that includes the giant panda (*Ailuropoda melanoleuca*), which is the most well-known and only extant species in this genus. Below is detailed information on the genus *Ailuropoda*, focusing on the giant panda as the primary representative, including species distribution, when the genus first appeared, and extinction status.\n\n### Species Distribution\n- **Current Distribution**: The giant panda (*Ailuropoda melanoleuca*) is native to south-central China. Its range is limited to a few mountain ranges, primarily in Sichuan Province, with smaller populations in Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces. They inhabit temperate montane forests, particularly those with dense bamboo understories, at elevations between 1,200 and 3,400 meters (3,900\u201311,200 feet).\n- **Historical Distribution**: Historically, giant pandas had a much wider range across southern and eastern China, as well as parts of Myanmar and northern Vietnam. Fossil evidence suggests their presence in lowland areas during prehistoric times, but habitat loss and human encroachment have restricted them to their current fragmented mountain habitats.\n\n### When the Genus First Appeared\n- The genus *Ailuropoda* is part of the bear family (*Ursidae*), and its lineage diverged from other bears relatively early. Fossil records indicate that *Ailuropoda* first appeared during the late Miocene to early Pliocene, approximately **8\u20139 million years ago**.\n- The earliest known species in this genus, *Ailuropoda microta*, is an extinct ancestor of the modern giant panda. Fossils of *A. microta* date back to about 2\u20132.4 million years ago during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene, found in southern China. This species was smaller than the modern giant panda but already showed adaptations for a bamboo diet.\n- The modern giant panda, *Ailuropoda melanoleuca*, likely evolved around **2\u20133 million years ago** during the Pleistocene, based on fossil evidence and genetic studies.\n\n### Extinction Status\n- **Extinct Species**: Several extinct species within the genus *Ailuropoda* have been identified through fossil records. These include:\n  - *Ailuropoda microta*: An early, smaller ancestor of the giant panda, known from fossils dating to about 2\u20132.4 million years ago. It became extinct during the early Pleistocene, likely due to environmental changes or competition.\n  - *Ailuropoda wulingshanensis*: Another extinct species, known from fossils in southern China, dating to the mid-Pleistocene. It was larger than *A. microta* but smaller than the modern giant panda. It likely went extinct due to climate shifts or habitat changes.\n  - *Ailuropoda baconi*: A larger extinct species from the Pleistocene, found in southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It lived approximately 750,000 to 10,000 years ago and may have coexisted with early populations of *A. melanoleuca*. It became extinct toward the end of the Pleistocene, possibly due to climate change and human activity.\n- **Extant Species**: The only living species in the genus is *Ailuropoda melanoleuca*, the giant panda. It is not extinct but is classified as **Vulnerable** by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as of the latest assessments. Thanks to conservation efforts, its population has been slowly recovering, with an estimated 1,800 individuals in the wild as of recent surveys. However, it still faces threats from habitat loss, fragmentation, and climate change impacting bamboo availability.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Evolutionary History**: *Ailuropoda* is unique among bears due to its specialized diet of bamboo, which constitutes over 99% of the giant panda's diet. This adaptation likely developed over millions of years as the genus evolved in bamboo-rich environments.\n- **Conservation**: The giant panda has become a global symbol of conservation. Efforts by the Chinese government, international organizations, and zoos have helped protect their habitat and increase their population through breeding programs and reintroduction initiatives.\n\nIf you would like more specific details on a particular extinct species within *Ailuropoda* or further information on the giant panda's biology or conservation status, please let me know!"

    "Ursidae": {
        "ancestor": "Carnivora",
        "info": "Ursidae is the family of mammals commonly known as bears. This family includes several extant species as well as extinct ones, and they are distributed across various parts of the world. Below is an overview of the family Ursidae, including species distribution, the first appearance of the family, and information on extinct species and when they became extinct.\n\n### Overview of Ursidae\n- **Classification**: Ursidae belongs to the order Carnivora and is part of the suborder Caniformia, which includes dog-like carnivores.\n- **First Appearance**: The family Ursidae first appeared during the late Eocene epoch, approximately 38-40 million years ago. The earliest known bear-like ancestors belong to the subfamily Amphicynodontinae, small bear-like creatures from the Eocene of North America and Europe. However, true bears (closer to modern species) emerged later, during the Oligocene to early Miocene, around 20-25 million years ago, with genera like *Ursavus*, considered one of the earliest true bear ancestors.\n- **Distribution**: Bears are native to a wide range of habitats across the Northern Hemisphere and parts of the Southern Hemisphere. They are found in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, but are absent from Africa (except for historical ranges of some species) and Australia.\n\n### Extant Species of Ursidae\nThere are eight living species of bears, classified into three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (pandas), Tremarctinae (short-faced bears), and Ursinae (true bears). Their current distributions are as follows:\n1. **Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)** - Subfamily Ailuropodinae\n   - Distribution: Restricted to a few mountain ranges in central China, primarily in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces.\n2. **Spectacled Bear (Tremarctos ornatus)** - Subfamily Tremarctinae\n   - Distribution: Found in the Andean regions of South America, including Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and possibly northern Argentina.\n3. **American Black Bear (Ursus americanus)** - Subfamily Ursinae\n   - Distribution: Widespread across North America, from Canada to the United States and parts of northern Mexico.\n4. **Brown Bear (Ursus arctos)** - Subfamily Ursinae\n   - Distribution: Found across much of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (e.g., grizzly bears in Alaska and Canada), Europe, and Asia (e.g., Siberian brown bears).\n5. **Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus)** - Subfamily Ursinae\n   - Distribution: Inhabits the Arctic region, primarily within the Arctic Circle, on sea ice and coastal areas of North America, Greenland, and northern Russia.\n6. **Asiatic Black Bear (Ursus thibetanus)** - Subfamily Ursinae\n   - Distribution: Found in Asia, from Iran and Afghanistan through India, China, Southeast Asia, and parts of Russia and Japan.\n7. **Sun Bear (Helarctos malayanus)** - Subfamily Ursinae\n   - Distribution: Native to tropical forests of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and parts of southern China and India.\n8. **Sloth Bear (Melursus ursinus)** - Subfamily Ursinae\n   - Distribution: Found in the Indian subcontinent, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Nepal and Bhutan.\n\n### Extinct Species and When They Became Extinct\nThe family Ursidae includes numerous extinct species, many of which are known from the fossil record. Some notable extinct species and genera include:\n1. **Cave Bear (Ursus spelaeus)** - Subfamily Ursinae\n   - Distribution: Once widespread across Europe, from Spain to the Ural Mountains.\n   - First Appearance: Emerged during the Middle Pleistocene, around 250,000 years ago.\n   - Extinction: Became extinct approximately 24,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum, likely due to climate change, habitat loss, and possibly human hunting or competition.\n2. **Short-Faced Bear (Arctodus simus)** - Subfamily Tremarctinae\n   - Distribution: Native to North America, ranging from Alaska to central Mexico.\n   - First Appearance: Emerged during the Pleistocene, around 1.8 million years ago.\n   - Extinction: Went extinct approximately 11,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene, likely due to climate change and the loss of large prey species during the Quaternary extinction event.\n3. **Florida Spectacled Bear (Tremarctos floridanus)** - Subfamily Tremarctinae\n   - Distribution: Found in southeastern North America, primarily in what is now Florida.\n   - First Appearance: Emerged during the Pleistocene.\n   - Extinction: Became extinct around 8,000-10,000 years ago, likely due to climate change and habitat alteration at the end of the Ice Age.\n4. **Agriotherium** - An extinct genus of early bears\n   - Distribution: Found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa during the Miocene and Pliocene.\n   - First Appearance: Around 13-14 million years ago.\n   - Extinction: Became extinct around 2.5 million years ago, likely due to competition with other carnivores and changing environmental conditions.\n5. **Ursavus** - An early bear genus, considered an ancestor to modern bears\n   - Distribution: Fossils found in Europe and Asia.\n   - First Appearance: Emerged during the late Oligocene to early Miocene, around 20-25 million years ago.\n   - Extinction: Disappeared by the mid-Miocene, around 10-15 million years ago, as it evolved into or was replaced by more modern bear lineages.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Evolutionary History**: Bears evolved from early caniform ancestors, with their lineage diverging from other carnivores like dogs and weasels. Over millions of years, they adapted to a variety of ecological niches, from the bamboo-eating giant panda to the hyper-carnivorous polar bear and the omnivorous brown bear.\n- **Conservation Status of Extant Species**: Many living bear species face threats due to habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. For example, the giant panda is classified as vulnerable, while the polar bear is threatened by melting sea ice due to global warming.\n- **Extinction Causes**: Most extinct bear species disappeared due to natural causes such as climate change, habitat shifts, and competition or predation pressures. Human activity may have contributed to the extinction of species like the cave bear during the late Pleistocene.\n\nIf you would like more detailed information on a specific bear species or extinct genus, please let me know!"

    "Carnivora": {
        "ancestor": "Laurasiatheria",
        "info": "**Carnivora** is not a single species but an order of mammals that includes a wide variety of carnivorous and omnivorous animals such as dogs, cats, bears, weasels, seals, and raccoons. The name \"Carnivora\" comes from Latin, meaning \"flesh-eating,\" though not all members of this order are strictly carnivorous. Below, I will provide an overview of the order Carnivora, including its distribution, evolutionary history, and information on extinction within the group.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nCarnivora is a highly diverse order with a global distribution. Members of this order are found on every continent, including Antarctica (where seals are present), and in a wide range of habitats, from arctic tundras to tropical rainforests, deserts, and aquatic environments. The order is divided into two suborders: **Feliformia** (cat-like carnivores, including cats, hyenas, and mongooses) and **Caniformia** (dog-like carnivores, including dogs, bears, raccoons, and seals). Specific distribution depends on the family or species:\n- **Felidae (cats)**: Found worldwide, from lions in African savannas to tigers in Asian forests and domestic cats globally.\n- **Canidae (dogs, wolves, foxes)**: Found in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and parts of South America.\n- **Ursidae (bears)**: Found in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia (e.g., polar bears in the Arctic, pandas in China).\n- **Pinnipedia (seals, sea lions, walruses)**: Found in marine environments, particularly in polar and temperate coastal regions.\n- **Mustelidae (weasels, otters, badgers)**: Widespread across North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa and South America.\n\n### **When the Species First Appeared**\nThe order Carnivora first appeared during the Paleocene epoch, approximately **60 million years ago (mya)**, shortly after the extinction of the dinosaurs. The earliest known carnivorans were small, weasel-like animals belonging to the extinct family **Miacidae**, which are considered the ancestors of modern carnivorans. These early carnivorans evolved in North America and Eurasia. Over millions of years, the order diversified into the wide array of forms seen today, adapting to various ecological niches.\n\nKey milestones in Carnivora evolution:\n- By the Eocene (56-33.9 mya), early carnivorans split into the two main suborders, Feliformia and Caniformia.\n- During the Oligocene and Miocene (33.9-5.3 mya), many modern families, such as Felidae (cats) and Canidae (dogs), emerged and spread across continents.\n- Pinnipeds (seals and relatives) evolved from terrestrial carnivorans during the Oligocene, adapting to aquatic life.\n\n### **Extinction Within Carnivora**\nWhile the order Carnivora as a whole is not extinct and includes many thriving species, several families, genera, and species within the order have gone extinct over geological time. Additionally, some modern species are critically endangered due to human activity. Below are details on extinct groups and species:\n\n#### **Extinct Families and Genera**\n- **Miacidae**: The earliest carnivorans, which lived from the Paleocene to the Eocene (60-40 mya), are entirely extinct. They were small, tree-dwelling mammals and are considered basal to modern Carnivora.\n- **Viverravidae**: Another early family of carnivorans from the Paleocene and Eocene, also extinct, sometimes considered a sister group to modern carnivorans.\n- **Nimravidae**: Often called \"false saber-toothed cats,\" this extinct family lived from the Eocene to the Miocene (37-7 mya). They resembled modern cats but were not directly related to them.\n- **Amphicyonidae**: Known as \"bear-dogs,\" this extinct family lived from the Eocene to the Miocene (45-9 mya). They were large, dog-like or bear-like predators.\n- **Hesperocyoninae**: An extinct subfamily of early canids (dog relatives) that lived from the Eocene to the Miocene (38-10 mya).\n\n#### **Notable Extinct Species**\nMany individual species within modern families of Carnivora have gone extinct, often due to climate change, competition, or human activity. Some prominent examples include:\n- **Smilodon fatalis** (saber-toothed cat): A member of the family Felidae, Smilodon became extinct around **10,000 years ago** during the late Pleistocene, likely due to climate change and the loss of large prey species, possibly compounded by human hunting.\n- **Cave Bear (Ursus spelaeus)**: A species of bear from the family Ursidae, it lived in Europe and became extinct around **24,000 years ago**, likely due to climate change and human competition for cave habitats during the last Ice Age.\n- **Dire Wolf (Aenocyon dirus)**: A large canid species from North and South America, it went extinct around **9,500 years ago** during the late Pleistocene, likely due to the extinction of large prey and competition with other predators, including early humans and gray wolves.\n- **Thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus)**: Although technically a marsupial and not a member of Carnivora, it is often mentioned in discussions of carnivorous mammals. This \"Tasmanian tiger\" became extinct in **1936** due to hunting, habitat loss, and disease introduced by European settlers.\n\n#### **Modern Extinctions and Endangered Species**\nWhile the order Carnivora persists, several species within it have gone extinct in historical times due to human activity, and many are currently endangered:\n- **Barbary Lion (Panthera leo leo)**: Considered extinct in the wild since the mid-20th century due to hunting and habitat loss in North Africa.\n- **Caspian Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris)**: Declared extinct in the 1970s due to hunting and habitat destruction in Central Asia.\n- Many current species, such as the Amur leopard, Sumatran tiger, and Ethiopian wolf, are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and climate change.\n\n### **Summary**\n- **Distribution**: Carnivora is a globally distributed order, with species adapted to diverse terrestrial, arboreal, and aquatic environments across all continents.\n- **First Appearance**: The order emerged around 60 million years ago during the Paleocene, with early forms like Miacidae evolving into the diverse families seen today.\n- **Extinction**: While the order itself is not extinct, numerous families (e.g., Miacidae, Nimravidae) and species (e.g., Smilodon, Dire Wolf) have gone extinct over millions of years due to natural causes like climate change and competition. In recent history, human activity has driven several species to extinction (e.g., Caspian Tiger) and threatens many others.\n\nIf you'd like detailed information on a specific family or species within Carnivora, please let me know!"

    "Laurasiatheria": {
        "ancestor": "Eutheria",
        "info": "Laurasiatheria is not a single species but a superorder of placental mammals that includes a diverse range of animals such as carnivores (e.g., dogs, cats), ungulates (e.g., cows, horses), bats, shrews, moles, and others. It is one of the four major clades of placental mammals, alongside Euarchontoglires, Xenarthra, and Afrotheria. Below is detailed information on Laurasiatheria as a group, including its distribution, evolutionary origins, and extinction status of some of its members.\n\n### Species Distribution\nLaurasiatheria is a highly diverse group with a global distribution, as its members have adapted to a wide variety of environments across continents. The superorder likely originated in the northern continents (Laurasia, hence the name), which included what is now North America, Europe, and Asia. Over time, members of Laurasiatheria spread to other regions, including Africa, South America, and Australasia, through migration and continental drift. Some examples of distribution include:\n- **Carnivora (e.g., lions, wolves, bears)**: Found worldwide, except in Antarctica and some remote islands.\n- **Chiroptera (bats)**: Found on every continent except Antarctica, with high diversity in tropical regions.\n- **Cetartiodactyla (whales, dolphins, cows, deer, pigs)**: Terrestrial members are found worldwide, while marine members (whales and dolphins) inhabit all oceans.\n- **Perissodactyla (horses, rhinos, tapirs)**: Historically widespread, now primarily in Africa, Asia, and parts of South America.\n- **Eulipotyphla (shrews, moles, hedgehogs)**: Found in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.\n- **Pholidota (pangolins)**: Found in Africa and Asia.\n\n### When Laurasiatheria First Appeared\nLaurasiatheria is believed to have originated during the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 85\u201390 million years ago, based on molecular clock studies and fossil evidence. This places their divergence after the split of placental mammals from other mammalian lineages but before the mass extinction event at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary (~66 million years ago) that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs. The earliest definitive fossils of Laurasiatherian mammals appear in the Paleocene epoch (around 66\u201356 million years ago), shortly after the K-Pg extinction, when mammals began to diversify rapidly. Early members of this group were likely small, insectivorous mammals.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies suggest that Laurasiatheria diverged into its major orders (e.g., Carnivora, Chiroptera, Cetartiodactyla) during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs (66\u201333.9 million years ago), with significant diversification occurring as mammals adapted to new ecological niches left vacant by the extinction of dinosaurs.\n\n### Extinction Status\nLaurasiatheria as a superorder is not extinct; it is a thriving group with many living species. However, numerous individual species and even entire families within Laurasiatheria have gone extinct over geological time, often due to climate change, habitat loss, competition, or human activity. Below are some notable examples of extinct Laurasiatherian groups or species and when they became extinct:\n- **Creodonta**: An extinct order of carnivorous mammals within Laurasiatheria that were once dominant predators. They appeared in the Paleocene (~60 million years ago) and went extinct by the late Miocene (~9 million years ago), likely outcompeted by modern Carnivora.\n- **Smilodon (Sabre-toothed cat)**: A well-known extinct genus of felid within Carnivora. Smilodon became extinct around 10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene, likely due to climate change and the disappearance of large prey species, possibly compounded by human hunting.\n- **Megatherium (Giant ground sloth)**: While often associated with Xenarthra, some extinct sloth-like mammals have historically been studied in relation to early Laurasiatherian lineages (though modern consensus places true sloths in Xenarthra). Many large mammals, including some Laurasiatherian ungulates, went extinct during the late Pleistocene (~12,000 years ago) due to climate shifts and human activity.\n- **Equus ferus (Wild horse ancestors)**: Some subspecies, like the Tarpan, became extinct in the wild in the early 20th century due to habitat loss and hunting, though domesticated horses (also within Perissodactyla) persist.\n- **Thylacine (Tasmanian tiger)**: A carnivorous marsupial-like mammal within Carnivora's distant relatives (though technically not a placental mammal, it\u2019s often discussed in similar contexts). It became extinct in 1936 due to hunting and habitat destruction by humans.\n\nMany living Laurasiatherian species are currently endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. Examples include certain species of rhinos (Perissodactyla), pangolins (Pholidota), and big cats (Carnivora).\n\n### Summary\n- **Distribution**: Laurasiatheria is globally distributed, with members adapted to nearly every terrestrial and marine environment.\n- **First Appearance**: Originated ~85\u201390 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous, with significant diversification in the Paleocene and Eocene (66\u201333.9 million years ago).\n- **Extinction Status**: The superorder itself is not extinct and includes many living species. However, numerous species and subgroups within Laurasiatheria have gone extinct at various points, especially during mass extinction events (e.g., K-Pg boundary) and the late Pleistocene (~12,000 years ago), often due to environmental changes and human impacts.\n\nIf you are looking for information on a specific species within Laurasiatheria, please let me know, and I can provide more targeted details!"

    "Eutheria": {
        "ancestor": "Theria",
        "info": "Eutheria, commonly referred to as placental mammals, is a major clade of mammals within the subclass Theria. This group includes a vast diversity of species, ranging from tiny shrews to massive whales, and encompasses humans as well. Below is detailed information on Eutheria regarding species distribution, their first appearance in the fossil record, and their current status regarding extinction.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nEutherian mammals are distributed across virtually every continent and major habitat on Earth, including terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments. Their adaptability to a wide range of ecological niches is largely due to the evolutionary innovation of the placenta, which allows for longer gestation periods and more developed offspring at birth. Key points about their distribution include:\n\n- **Geographic Range**: Eutherians are found on all continents, including Antarctica (where seals and whales can be found in surrounding waters). They inhabit diverse environments such as tropical rainforests, deserts, grasslands, tundra, and oceans.\n- **Diversity**: There are over 4,000 extant species of eutherian mammals, classified into numerous orders such as Primates (e.g., humans, monkeys), Carnivora (e.g., dogs, cats), Cetartiodactyla (e.g., whales, cows), Rodentia (e.g., mice, squirrels), and Chiroptera (bats), among others.\n- **Examples of Distribution**:\n  - Rodents and bats are nearly cosmopolitan, found in almost every terrestrial habitat.\n  - Marine eutherians like whales and dolphins are distributed across global oceans.\n  - Some species, like certain primates or large mammals (e.g., elephants), are restricted to specific regions due to habitat requirements or human impact.\n\n### **First Appearance**\nEutherian mammals first appeared during the early Cretaceous period, with the oldest widely accepted eutherian fossil dating to approximately **125 million years ago**. Key details include:\n\n- **Fossil Evidence**: One of the earliest known eutherian mammals is *Juramaia sinensis*, discovered in China and dated to about 160 million years ago (Late Jurassic), though its classification as a true eutherian is debated. More widely accepted early eutherians, such as *Eomaia scansoria* (from the Early Cretaceous, about 125 million years ago), also found in China, provide strong evidence of early placental mammal evolution.\n- **Evolutionary Context**: Eutherians likely diverged from other mammals, such as metatherians (marsupials), during the Jurassic or early Cretaceous. Their early evolution occurred alongside dinosaurs, and they remained small, insectivorous, or omnivorous creatures until the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous (66 million years ago) allowed for rapid diversification.\n- **Key Innovation**: The development of the placenta, which enables extended intrauterine development and nourishment of the fetus, is a defining feature that likely contributed to their evolutionary success.\n\n### **Extinction Status**\nEutheria as a clade is **not extinct** and remains one of the most successful and diverse groups of mammals today. However, many individual species within Eutheria have gone extinct over geological time, and numerous extant species are currently threatened due to human activities. Key points include:\n\n- **Historical Extinctions**: Many eutherian species, particularly during the late Pleistocene (approximately 50,000 to 10,000 years ago), went extinct during the Quaternary extinction event. This event saw the loss of megafauna such as mammoths, saber-toothed cats (*Smilodon*), and giant ground sloths, likely due to a combination of climate change and human hunting.\n- **Current Status**: While the clade as a whole thrives, numerous eutherian species are endangered or critically endangered today due to habitat loss, climate change, poaching, and other anthropogenic factors. Examples include the Amur leopard, black rhinoceros, and various species of primates.\n- **Conservation Efforts**: Efforts are underway globally to protect threatened eutherian species through habitat preservation, breeding programs, and legal protections. Organizations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) track the status of these species on the Red List.\n\n### **Summary**\n- **Distribution**: Eutherian mammals are globally distributed across diverse habitats on every continent and in every ocean, with over 4,000 extant species.\n- **First Appearance**: They first appeared in the fossil record around 125\u2013160 million years ago during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, with early representatives like *Juramaia* and *Eomaia*.\n- **Extinction**: The clade is not extinct and is highly successful today, though many individual species have gone extinct in the past (e.g., during the late Pleistocene), and numerous current species face extinction risks due to human impact.\n\nIf you would like more specific information on a particular eutherian order, family, or species, or further details on their evolutionary history, please let me know!"

        "common": "andean mountain cat",
        "ancestor": "Leopardus",
        "info": "Leopardus jacobita, commonly known as the Andean cat or Andean mountain cat, is a small wild cat species native to the high Andes of South America. Below is detailed information about the species, including its distribution, first appearance, and conservation status (including whether it is extinct).\n\n### Species Overview\n- **Scientific Name**: Leopardus jacobita (previously classified as Oreailurus jacobita)\n- **Common Names**: Andean cat, Andean mountain cat\n- **Family**: Felidae\n- **Description**: The Andean cat is a small, elusive feline with a thick, silvery-gray fur coat marked with dark spots and stripes. It has a long, bushy tail and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It weighs between 4-7 kg (8.8-15.4 lbs) and has a body length of about 57-85 cm (22-33 inches), excluding the tail.\n\n### Species Distribution\n- **Current Range**: The Andean cat is found in the high Andes mountains of South America, primarily in:\n  - Argentina (northwestern regions)\n  - Bolivia (western highlands)\n  - Chile (northern areas)\n  - Peru (southern and central highlands)\n- **Habitat**: It inhabits rocky, arid, and semi-arid environments at elevations typically between 3,000 and 5,000 meters (9,800-16,400 feet) above sea level, often above the tree line. Its habitat includes montane grasslands, shrublands, and areas near wetlands.\n- **Population**: The species is very rare and has a fragmented distribution due to its specialized habitat requirements. Population estimates are uncertain, but it is believed to be one of the rarest small cats in the world, with fewer than 1,500 mature individuals remaining in the wild.\n\n### First Appearance (Evolutionary History)\n- **Evolutionary Lineage**: The Andean cat belongs to the genus *Leopardus*, which includes other small South American wild cats like the ocelot and margay. Genetic studies suggest that *Leopardus jacobita* diverged from its closest relatives, such as the Pampas cat (*Leopardus colocola*), around 1.5 to 2 million years ago during the Pleistocene epoch.\n- **Fossil Record**: There is no extensive fossil record specifically for *Leopardus jacobita*, but the genus *Leopardus* has been present in South America for millions of years, evolving in response to the uplift of the Andes and the resulting high-altitude ecosystems.\n- **First Description**: The species was first scientifically described in 1865 by Emilio Cornalia, based on specimens collected in Bolivia. Its name honors Jacobita Manteufel, though little is known about this namesake.\n\n### Extinction Status\n- **Is the Species Extinct?**: No, the Andean cat is not extinct. However, it is classified as **Endangered** on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List due to its small population size, habitat loss, and other threats.\n- **Conservation Challenges**:\n  - **Habitat Loss**: Mining, agriculture, and grazing by livestock degrade its high-altitude habitat.\n  - **Prey Decline**: Reduction in populations of its primary prey, such as mountain viscachas and small rodents, due to human activities.\n  - **Human Conflict**: In some areas, Andean cats are killed by local people due to superstition or perceived threats to livestock (though they rarely prey on domestic animals).\n  - **Climate Change**: Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns may alter its high-altitude habitat.\n- **Conservation Efforts**: Organizations like the Andean Cat Alliance (Alianza Gato Andino) are working to protect the species through research, community education, and habitat conservation. Camera traps and genetic studies are helping to monitor populations.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The Andean cat is one of the least studied felids in the world due to its remote habitat and elusive nature. Much of what is known about the species comes from camera trap footage and local reports.\n- It holds cultural significance for some Andean indigenous communities, where it is sometimes associated with spiritual beliefs or seen as a symbol of the mountains.\n\nIf you have further questions or would like more specific details about the Andean cat, feel free to ask!"

    "Leopardus": {
        "ancestor": "Felinae",
        "info": "**Leopardus** is a genus of small wild cats native to the Americas, belonging to the family Felidae. This genus includes several species commonly referred to as ocelots, margays, and other small spotted cats. Below is an overview of the genus, including species distribution, evolutionary history, and extinction status of specific species where applicable.\n\n### **General Overview of Leopardus**\n- **Taxonomy**: The genus Leopardus is part of the subfamily Felinae, which includes small to medium-sized cats. It is closely related to other genera like Lynx and Puma.\n- **Characteristics**: Species in this genus are typically small to medium-sized, with spotted or rosetted fur patterns. They are arboreal or terrestrial hunters, adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from forests to grasslands.\n- **Evolutionary History**: The genus Leopardus is believed to have diverged from other felid lineages around 6\u20138 million years ago during the late Miocene epoch, based on genetic and fossil evidence. Their diversification likely occurred in South America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed for migration and speciation.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nThe genus Leopardus is primarily distributed across Central and South America, with some species extending into parts of North America (e.g., southern United States and Mexico). Below are the main species currently recognized in the genus, along with their distribution:\n\n1. **Leopardus pardalis (Ocelot)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found from the southwestern United States (southern Texas and Arizona) through Mexico, Central America, and into South America as far south as northern Argentina and Uruguay. They inhabit a variety of habitats, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and mangrove swamps.\n   - **Status**: Not extinct; listed as Least Concern by the IUCN, though populations are declining in some areas due to habitat loss and hunting.\n\n2. **Leopardus wiedii (Margay)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Ranges from Mexico through Central America and into South America, as far south as northern Argentina and Uruguay. They prefer dense tropical forests and are highly arboreal.\n   - **Status**: Not extinct; listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN due to habitat destruction and fragmentation.\n\n3. **Leopardus geoffroyi (Geoffroy\u2019s Cat)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found in southern South America, including parts of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. They inhabit grasslands, scrublands, and forests.\n   - **Status**: Not extinct; listed as Least Concern by the IUCN, though local populations face threats from habitat loss.\n\n4. **Leopardus guttulus (Southern Tiger Cat)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found in southern Brazil, Paraguay, and northern Argentina. They live in tropical and subtropical forests.\n   - **Status**: Not extinct; listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat loss.\n\n5. **Leopardus tigrinus (Northern Tiger Cat or Oncilla)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found in Central America (Costa Rica, Panama) and northern South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, and parts of Brazil. They inhabit cloud forests and lowland rainforests.\n   - **Status**: Not extinct; listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat loss and fragmentation.\n\n6. **Leopardus colocola (Colocolo or Pampas Cat)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found in a wide range across South America, including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Uruguay. They inhabit grasslands, deserts, and mountainous regions.\n   - **Status**: Not extinct; listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.\n\n7. **Leopardus jacobita (Andean Mountain Cat)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Restricted to the high Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru, typically above 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) in rocky, arid environments.\n   - **Status**: Not extinct; listed as Endangered by the IUCN due to its small population size, restricted range, and habitat threats.\n\n8. **Leopardus guigna (Kodkod or G\u00fci\u00f1a)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found in central and southern Chile and a small part of western Argentina. They inhabit temperate rainforests and scrublands.\n   - **Status**: Not extinct; listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat loss and persecution.\n\n### **When the Species First Appeared**\nThe genus Leopardus likely originated in South America around 6\u20138 million years ago, based on molecular studies and fossil records. The earliest fossils attributed to Leopardus or closely related ancestors date to the late Miocene or early Pliocene. Specific species within the genus diverged more recently:\n- **Ocelot (L. pardalis)** and **Margay (L. wiedii)** lineages likely split around 2\u20133 million years ago during the Pliocene.\n- Other species, such as the Andean Mountain Cat and Kodkod, likely diverged within the last 1\u20132 million years during the Pleistocene, as South American landscapes and climates changed.\n\nFossil evidence for specific Leopardus species is sparse, but remains of small cats resembling modern species have been found in South American deposits from the Pleistocene (2.5 million to 11,700 years ago).\n\n### **Extinction Status**\nNone of the currently recognized species in the genus Leopardus are extinct. However, several species are threatened due to habitat loss, hunting, and human encroachment. Below is a summary of their conservation status:\n- **Endangered**: Andean Mountain Cat (L. jacobita)\n- **Vulnerable**: Northern Tiger Cat (L. tigrinus), Southern Tiger Cat (L. guttulus), Kodkod (L. guigna)\n- **Near Threatened**: Margay (L. wiedii), Colocolo (L. colocola)\n- **Least Concern**: Ocelot (L. pardalis), Geoffroy\u2019s Cat (L. geoffroyi)\n\nThere are no well-documented extinct species within the genus Leopardus, though it is possible that undiscovered or poorly studied fossil species existed in the past. Additionally, local extinctions (extirpations) of certain species have occurred in parts of their historical ranges due to human activity.\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n- The taxonomy of Leopardus has undergone revisions in recent years due to genetic studies. For example, the Northern and Southern Tiger Cats were once considered a single species (L. tigrinus) but are now recognized as distinct.\n- Conservation efforts are critical for several Leopardus species, especially those with restricted ranges or small populations, such as the Andean Mountain Cat.\n\nIf you would like more detailed information on a specific Leopardus species or aspect (e.g., behavior, ecology, or conservation), please let me know!"

    "Felinae": {
        "ancestor": "Felidae",
        "info": "Felinae is a subfamily of the family Felidae, which encompasses the small to medium-sized cats. This group includes a wide variety of species, such as domestic cats, lynxes, ocelots, and many others. Unlike their larger relatives in the subfamily Pantherinae (which includes lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars), members of Felinae generally cannot roar due to differences in their hyoid bone structure. Below is a detailed overview of the Felinae subfamily, including species distribution, their first appearance, and extinction information where applicable.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nFelinae species are found across a wide range of habitats on nearly every continent, except for Antarctica and Australia (though domestic cats have been introduced to Australia by humans). Their distribution varies by genus and species, but collectively, they inhabit forests, grasslands, deserts, and mountainous regions. Some notable genera and their distributions include:\n- **Felis**: Includes the domestic cat (Felis catus) and wild species like the European wildcat (Felis silvestris), found in Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia.\n- **Lynx**: Found in the Northern Hemisphere, including North America (Canadian lynx and bobcat) and Eurasia (Eurasian lynx and Iberian lynx).\n- **Puma**: The cougar (Puma concolor) is found in the Americas, ranging from Canada to South America.\n- **Leopardus**: Includes species like the ocelot and margay, primarily found in Central and South America.\n- **Prionailurus**: Includes the fishing cat and leopard cat, found in South and Southeast Asia.\n- **Acinonyx**: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population in Iran.\n\nMany Felinae species are highly adaptable, which contributes to their wide distribution. However, habitat loss and human activity have reduced the range of many species, such as the Iberian lynx, which is now critically endangered and restricted to small areas in Spain and Portugal.\n\n### **First Appearance**\nThe subfamily Felinae is believed to have diverged from other felids around 10\u201315 million years ago during the Miocene epoch, based on fossil records and genetic studies. The earliest known members of Felinae likely evolved in Eurasia. One of the earliest genera associated with Felinae is *Pseudaelurus*, which lived around 20\u201310 million years ago and is considered an ancestor to modern small cats. Over time, Felinae diversified into the various genera and species we see today.\n\nThe evolutionary history of Felinae shows a gradual adaptation to different ecological niches, with some species becoming specialized hunters in specific environments (e.g., the fishing cat in wetlands, the cheetah in open plains). Molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that the lineage leading to modern Felinae split from Pantherinae (big cats) approximately 10.8 million years ago.\n\n### **Extinction Status and Historical Extinctions**\nThe subfamily Felinae as a whole is not extinct and includes many extant (living) species. However, certain species and subspecies within Felinae have gone extinct, often due to human activities, habitat destruction, or climate change. Additionally, some prehistoric members of Felinae are extinct. Below are details on extinction within this subfamily:\n- **Extant Species**: Most Felinae genera include living species. For example, the domestic cat (Felis catus), cougar (Puma concolor), and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) are still present, though some face significant conservation challenges.\n- **Extinct Species/Subspecies**:\n  - Several prehistoric Felinae species, such as members of the genus *Pseudaelurus*, became extinct millions of years ago as part of natural evolutionary processes.\n  - More recently, some subspecies of modern Felinae have gone extinct due to human influence. For example, the Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) was once thought to belong to Felinae in older classifications, but it is now classified under Pantherinae. However, within Felinae, specific populations like certain regional subspecies of lynx or wildcat have disappeared.\n  - While no widely recognized modern Felinae species has gone completely extinct in historical times, many are critically endangered, such as the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), which nearly went extinct in the early 21st century before conservation efforts helped recover its population.\n- **Prehistoric Extinctions**: During the Pleistocene epoch (2.58 million to 11,700 years ago), several Felinae-like cats, including early lynx and puma relatives in North America and Eurasia, went extinct, likely due to climate change and competition with other predators.\n\n### **Conservation Note**\nWhile the subfamily Felinae is not extinct, many of its species are under threat. Habitat loss, poaching, and climate change pose significant risks to species like the cheetah, fishing cat, and various wildcat species. Conservation programs, such as breeding and reintroduction efforts for the Iberian lynx, have shown success in preventing further extinctions within this subfamily.\n\nIf you are looking for information on a specific Felinae species, feel free to ask for more detailed information on that particular cat!"

        "ancestor": "Feliformia",
        "info": "**Felidae (Family of Cats)**\n\n**Overview**: Felidae is the biological family of cats, encompassing a wide range of species from small domestic cats to large wild cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. This family is part of the order Carnivora and is characterized by their retractable claws, sharp teeth, keen senses, and typically solitary and territorial behavior (though some species, like lions, are social). There are two main subfamilies within Felidae: Pantherinae (big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards) and Felinae (smaller cats like cheetahs, lynxes, and domestic cats).\n\n---\n\n**Species Distribution**:\n- Felidae species are distributed across every continent except Antarctica and Australia (though domestic cats have been introduced to Australia by humans). Their natural range includes:\n  - **Africa**: Home to species like lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus), and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus).\n  - **Asia**: Hosts tigers (Panthera tigris), snow leopards (Panthera uncia), and smaller cats like the Asiatic wildcat (Felis lybica ornata).\n  - **Europe**: Historically home to species like the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), though populations have declined in many areas.\n  - **North America**: Includes species like the cougar (Puma concolor), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis).\n  - **South America**: Home to the jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and other small wildcats.\n- Many Felidae species have adapted to diverse habitats, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and mountainous regions. However, habitat loss and human activity have significantly reduced their ranges.\n\nThere are currently **41 recognized species** in the Felidae family, though taxonomy can vary slightly depending on genetic studies and classification updates.\n\n---\n\n**When the Species First Appeared**:\n- The family Felidae first appeared during the late Eocene to early Oligocene epochs, approximately **25-30 million years ago**. The earliest known felid-like ancestors were part of a group called Nimravidae, often referred to as \"false cats,\" which existed around 40 million years ago. However, true Felidae diverged from other carnivorans around 25 million years ago.\n- The genus *Proailurus*, considered one of the earliest true cats, appeared around 25 million years ago in Europe. It was a small, arboreal predator and is thought to be a direct ancestor of modern cats.\n- Over millions of years, Felidae diversified into various lineages. The split between Pantherinae (big cats) and Felinae (small cats) occurred around **10-15 million years ago** during the Miocene epoch.\n\n---\n\n**Extinction and Extinct Species**:\n- While the family Felidae as a whole is not extinct, many individual species and subspecies within the family have gone extinct, primarily due to climate change, habitat loss, and human activities. Some notable extinct Felidae include:\n  - **Smilodon** (commonly known as the saber-toothed cat): This iconic genus, which includes species like *Smilodon fatalis* and *Smilodon populator*, lived during the Pleistocene epoch and became extinct around **10,000 years ago**, likely due to climate change and the loss of large prey species after the last Ice Age, combined with human hunting pressures.\n  - **Homotherium** (another saber-toothed cat): This genus, often called the scimitar-toothed cat, existed from about 4 million to 10,000 years ago and roamed parts of North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It went extinct around the same time as *Smilodon*, likely for similar reasons.\n  - **American Lion (Panthera atrox)**: One of the largest cats to have ever lived, this species roamed North America during the Pleistocene and became extinct around **11,000 years ago**, likely due to the same environmental changes and human impact that affected other megafauna.\n  - **Cave Lion (Panthera spelaea)**: Closely related to modern lions, this species lived in Europe and parts of Asia during the Pleistocene and went extinct around **14,000 years ago**, again tied to climate change and human activity.\n- Many modern Felidae species are currently endangered or critically endangered, such as the Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis), Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), and Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), due to habitat destruction, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Distribution**: Felidae species are found worldwide (except Antarctica and naturally in Australia), adapted to a variety of habitats.\n- **First Appearance**: The family Felidae emerged around 25-30 million years ago, with early ancestors like *Proailurus*.\n- **Extinction**: While the family itself is not extinct, several prehistoric species (e.g., *Smilodon*, *Homotherium*, *Panthera atrox*) became extinct around 10,000-14,000 years ago due to climate change, loss of prey, and human impact.

    "Feliformia": {
        "ancestor": "Carnivora",
        "info": "Feliformia is a suborder of the order Carnivora, which includes cat-like carnivorous mammals. It encompasses a diverse group of species, including cats (both big and small), hyenas, mongooses, civets, and related families. Below is detailed information on Feliformia regarding its distribution, first appearance, and extinction status of its lineages.\n\n### Species Distribution\nFeliformia species are widely distributed across the globe, with the highest diversity found in Africa and Asia. Their range includes:\n- **Africa**: Home to many feliform species, including lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, and numerous small carnivores like genets and mongooses.\n- **Asia**: Hosts a variety of species such as tigers, snow leopards, clouded leopards, and civets.\n- **Europe**: Limited to a few species like the Eurasian lynx and European wildcat.\n- **Americas**: Only a few feliform species are native, such as the jaguar, puma, and ocelot, primarily in Central and South America. North America has species like the bobcat and Canada lynx.\n- **Australia and Antarctica**: No native feliforms are present, though domestic and feral cats have been introduced to Australia, where they are considered invasive.\n\nFeliforms inhabit a wide range of habitats, from tropical rainforests and savannas to deserts and mountainous regions, depending on the specific family or species.\n\n### First Appearance\nFeliformia first appeared during the early Paleogene period, approximately 40-50 million years ago (Mya), with the divergence of early carnivoran lineages. The suborder is believed to have originated in Eurasia, with fossil evidence of early feliforms dating back to the Eocene epoch. One of the earliest known feliform ancestors belongs to the family **Viverravidae**, a group of primitive carnivorans that existed around 50 Mya, though they are not direct ancestors of modern feliforms.\n\nThe modern families within Feliformia began to diversify during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs (around 30-20 Mya). Key families include:\n- **Felidae** (cats): First appeared around 25 Mya.\n- **Hyaenidae** (hyenas): Emerged around 22 Mya.\n- **Viverridae** (civets, genets): Appeared around 30 Mya.\n- **Herpestidae** (mongooses): Originated around 20 Mya.\n\n### Extinction Status\nFeliformia as a suborder is not extinct; it includes many extant species. However, numerous individual species and genera within Feliformia have gone extinct over millions of years due to climate change, habitat loss, competition, and human activity. Below are some notable points regarding extinctions within the group:\n- **Prehistoric Extinctions**: Many ancient feliform lineages, such as the saber-toothed cats (e.g., *Smilodon*), went extinct during the Pleistocene epoch, around 10,000-12,000 years ago, likely due to a combination of climate change and human hunting pressures. *Smilodon fatalis*, for instance, disappeared around 10,000 years ago.\n- **Modern Extinctions**: Some feliform species have gone extinct in historical times due to human activities. For example:\n  - The **Barbary lion** (*Panthera leo leo*), native to North Africa, is considered extinct in the wild since the mid-20th century, though some individuals may survive in captivity.\n  - The **Caspian tiger** (*Panthera tigris virgata*), native to Central Asia, became extinct in the 1970s due to habitat loss and hunting.\n- **Current Status**: Many extant feliform species are threatened or endangered today due to habitat destruction, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Examples include the Amur leopard (*Panthera pardus orientalis*), with fewer than 100 individuals left in the wild, and the Iberian lynx (*Lynx pardinus*), which has seen population declines but is recovering due to conservation efforts.\n\n### Summary\nFeliformia is a thriving suborder with a wide global distribution, particularly in Africa and Asia, tracing its origins to around 40-50 million years ago. While the suborder itself is not extinct, many of its prehistoric and historical species have disappeared, and several modern species face significant threats. Conservation efforts are critical to preserving the diversity of this fascinating group of carnivores.

    "Placentalia": {
        "ancestor": "Eutheria",
        "info": "**Placentalia Overview**\n\nPlacentalia is a clade of mammals characterized by the presence of a placenta, an organ that facilitates nutrient and waste exchange between the mother and the developing fetus during pregnancy. This group includes the vast majority of living mammals, such as humans, dogs, cats, whales, bats, and elephants, among others. Placental mammals are distinguished from other mammal groups like monotremes (egg-laying mammals such as the platypus) and marsupials (pouched mammals like kangaroos), by their reproductive strategy, which typically involves longer gestation periods and the birth of more developed offspring.\n\nBelow is detailed information on the species distribution, evolutionary origins, and extinction status of Placentalia as a group.\n\n---\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nPlacental mammals (Placentalia) are found across the globe, inhabiting nearly every terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environment. Their distribution spans all continents, including Antarctica (where certain marine placental mammals like seals and whales can be found near the coast). The diversity of placental mammals is immense, with over 5,000 living species classified into various orders such as Primates, Rodentia, Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla (whales and even-toed ungulates), Chiroptera (bats), and many others.\n\n- **Terrestrial Distribution**: Placental mammals dominate terrestrial ecosystems, with species like rodents (e.g., mice, rats) and ungulates (e.g., deer, cows) found in grasslands, forests, deserts, and tundra. Large carnivores like lions and bears inhabit various biomes, while primates are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions.\n- **Aquatic Distribution**: Marine placental mammals, such as whales, dolphins, and seals, are distributed across all oceans. Some, like manatees, inhabit coastal and riverine environments.\n- **Aerial Distribution**: Bats, the only mammals capable of sustained flight, are found worldwide, except in extreme polar regions and some remote oceanic islands.\n\nThe adaptability of placental mammals to diverse environments is largely due to their physiological and behavioral innovations, including the placenta, which allows for extended gestation and better-developed newborns.\n\n---\n\n### **When Placentalia First Appeared**\nPlacental mammals are part of the larger group Eutheria, which includes both living placental mammals and some extinct relatives. The evolutionary history of Placentalia is traced through fossil records and molecular studies.\n\n- **Earliest Evidence**: The earliest known eutherian mammals, which are ancestors or close relatives of Placentalia, date back to the Early Cretaceous period, approximately 125 million years ago (mya). A notable early eutherian is *Juramaia sinensis*, discovered in China, which lived around 160 mya (though its exact placement in relation to Placentalia is debated). This suggests that the lineage leading to placental mammals diverged from other mammals (like marsupials) during the Jurassic or Early Cretaceous.\n- **Crown Placentalia**: The \"crown group\" of Placentalia, which includes the common ancestor of all living placental mammals and their descendants, likely originated around 90\u2013100 mya during the Late Cretaceous, based on molecular clock estimates. However, the oldest undisputed fossils of crown placental mammals appear after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, around 66 mya, which wiped out non-avian dinosaurs and allowed mammals to diversify rapidly.\n- **Post-K-Pg Diversification**: Following the mass extinction event 66 mya, placental mammals underwent an explosive radiation during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs (66\u201333.9 mya), leading to the emergence of major modern orders.\n\n---\n\n### **Extinction Status**\nPlacentalia as a clade is **not extinct** and represents the most diverse and successful group of mammals today. However, many individual species and lineages within Placentalia have gone extinct over millions of years, and some are currently threatened due to human activities.\n\n- **Extinct Lineages**: Numerous ancient placental mammal groups have gone extinct. For example:\n  - *Creodonts* (an extinct group of carnivorous mammals) and *Condylarths* (early ungulate-like mammals) thrived during the Paleocene and Eocene but became extinct by the Miocene (around 23\u20135 mya) as they were outcompeted by modern carnivores and ungulates.\n  - Specific species like the woolly mammoth (*Mammuthus primigenius*), a placental mammal of the order Proboscidea, became extinct around 4,000 years ago due to climate change and human hunting.\n  - The saber-toothed cats (*Smilodon* spp.), placental mammals of the family Felidae, went extinct around 10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene, likely due to a combination of climate change and loss of prey.\n- **Current Status**: While Placentalia as a group is thriving, many species are endangered or have gone extinct in recent history due to habitat loss, climate change, hunting, and other anthropogenic factors. Examples include the extinction of the thylacine (a marsupial, though often compared to placental wolves) and ongoing threats to species like the African elephant, giant panda, and various whale species.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- **Distribution**: Placental mammals are globally distributed, occupying terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial niches across all continents and oceans.\n- **First Appearance**: The lineage leading to Placentalia likely emerged in the Early Cretaceous (~125\u2013160 mya), with crown Placentalia diversifying in the Late Cretaceous (~90\u2013100 mya) and undergoing rapid radiation after the K-Pg extinction event (~66 mya).\n- **Extinction**: Placentalia as a clade is not extinct and remains highly diverse. However, many individual species and ancient lineages within Placentalia have gone extinct over geological time, with some extinctions occurring as recently as a few thousand years ago, and many current species face extinction risks due to human impact.\n\nIf you would like more specific information about a particular order, family, or species within Placentalia, please let me know!"

        "ancestor": "Macropodidae",
        "info": "**Macropus** is a genus of large marsupials commonly known as kangaroos and wallaroos, belonging to the family Macropodidae. This genus includes some of the most iconic and well-known marsupials native to Australia. Below is detailed information on the genus Macropus, including species distribution, evolutionary history, and extinction status of specific species.\n\n### Overview of Macropus\n- **Classification**: Genus Macropus, Family Macropodidae, Order Diprotodontia.\n- **Common Names**: Kangaroos, wallaroos.\n- **Characteristics**: Members of the genus Macropus are large, herbivorous marsupials with strong hind legs adapted for hopping, long tails for balance, and pouches for carrying their young (joeys).\n\n### Species Distribution\nThe genus Macropus is primarily distributed across Australia, with some species also found in New Guinea. The distribution varies depending on the species, as they are adapted to a wide range of habitats including grasslands, woodlands, savannas, and arid regions. Below are some of the most well-known species in the genus and their distributions:\n\n1. **Macropus rufus (Red Kangaroo)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found throughout much of mainland Australia, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions such as deserts and grasslands. It avoids densely forested areas and coastal regions.\n   \n2. **Macropus giganteus (Eastern Grey Kangaroo)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and parts of South Australia. It inhabits grasslands, woodlands, and open forests.\n   \n3. **Macropus fuliginosus (Western Grey Kangaroo)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found in southern and western Australia, including Western Australia, South Australia, and parts of Victoria and New South Wales. It prefers open woodlands and grasslands.\n   \n4. **Macropus antilopinus (Antilopine Kangaroo)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Restricted to northern Australia, including the northern parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. It inhabits tropical woodlands and grasslands.\n   \n5. **Macropus robustus (Common Wallaroo or Euro)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Widespread across Australia, found in rocky hills, grasslands, and arid regions. It has several subspecies adapted to different environments.\n\nSome species of Macropus are also found in New Guinea, such as:\n- **Macropus agilis (Agile Wallaby)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found in northern Australia and southern New Guinea, typically in grasslands and open woodlands near water sources.\n\n### Evolutionary History and First Appearance\n- **First Appearance**: The genus Macropus is believed to have first appeared during the late Miocene to early Pliocene epochs, approximately 5\u201310 million years ago. Fossil evidence suggests that early macropods evolved from smaller, more generalized marsupial ancestors in response to changing environmental conditions in Australia, such as the expansion of grasslands.\n- **Evolutionary Context**: The genus Macropus evolved as part of the adaptive radiation of macropods, a group of marsupials that developed specialized hopping locomotion to efficiently traverse open landscapes. Fossil records indicate that larger species like those in Macropus became more prominent as Australia's climate became drier and grasslands expanded.\n\n### Extinction Status\nWhile many species within the genus Macropus are extant (still living), some species and subspecies have gone extinct, primarily due to human activities, habitat loss, and the introduction of invasive species. Below are details on extinct species and subspecies within Macropus:\n\n1. **Macropus titan (Extinct Giant Kangaroo)**  \n   - **Extinction**: This species is believed to have gone extinct during the late Pleistocene, around 40,000\u201350,000 years ago, likely due to climate change and human hunting pressures after the arrival of Aboriginal peoples in Australia.\n   - **Distribution (Historical)**: Fossil evidence suggests it lived across much of Australia.\n   - **Notes**: Macropus titan was one of the largest kangaroos, comparable in size to the modern Red Kangaroo or even larger.\n\n2. **Macropus greyi (Toolache Wallaby)**  \n   - **Extinction**: Became extinct in the early 20th century, with the last confirmed sighting in 1924. Official extinction is often dated to around 1939 when the last known individual died in captivity.\n   - **Cause of Extinction**: Habitat destruction due to European settlement, hunting for sport and fur, and predation by introduced species like foxes.\n   - **Distribution (Historical)**: Native to southeastern South Australia and southwestern Victoria, inhabiting grasslands and swampy areas.\n\n3. **Other Extinct Subspecies or Populations**: Some localized populations or subspecies of Macropus, such as certain island populations of wallaroos or kangaroos, may have gone extinct due to habitat fragmentation or other anthropogenic factors, though comprehensive records are not always available.\n\n### Conservation Status of Extant Species\nMost extant species of Macropus are not currently threatened, and some, like the Red Kangaroo and Eastern Grey Kangaroo, are abundant and even considered pests in certain areas due to overpopulation and competition with livestock for resources. However, some species face challenges:\n- **Macropus antilopinus (Antilopine Kangaroo)**: Near Threatened due to habitat loss and potential impacts of climate change in northern Australia.\n- Smaller or more localized species, like certain wallabies within the genus, may face threats from habitat destruction and predation by introduced species.\n\n### Summary\n- **Distribution**: Primarily Australia, with some species in New Guinea; habitats range from arid deserts to tropical woodlands.\n- **First Appearance**: Late Miocene to early Pliocene (5\u201310 million years ago).\n- **Extinction**: Some species, such as Macropus titan (late Pleistocene) and Macropus greyi (early 20th century), are extinct, primarily due to human impact and environmental changes. Most modern species are extant, though some face conservation challenges.\n\nIf you would like more detailed information on a specific species within the genus Macropus, please let me know!"

        "ancestor": "Macropodiformes",
        "info": "**Macropodidae** is a family of marsupials commonly known as kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos, and related species. This family is primarily native to Australia and nearby regions, and they are iconic for their large hind legs, strong tails, and distinctive hopping locomotion. Below is detailed information on the Macropodidae family, including species distribution, their first appearance in the fossil record, and extinction details for specific extinct species within the family.\n\n### Overview of Macropodidae\n- **Classification**: Macropodidae belongs to the order Diprotodontia, which includes most marsupials native to Australasia. The name \"Macropodidae\" means \"big foot,\" referring to their large hind feet adapted for hopping.\n- **Living Members**: The family includes over 60 extant species, with the most well-known genera being *Macropus* (kangaroos and wallabies), *Dendrolagus* (tree-kangaroos), and *Lagorchestes* (hare-wallabies).\n- **Characteristics**: Macropods are herbivorous, with most species adapted to grazing or browsing. They have a unique reproductive system involving a short gestation period followed by a long period of development in the mother's pouch.\n\n### Species Distribution\nMacropodidae species are predominantly found in Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands. Their distribution varies based on habitat preferences:\n- **Australia**: The majority of macropod species, including the red kangaroo (*Macropus rufus*), eastern grey kangaroo (*Macropus giganteus*), and various wallabies, are found across diverse habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and deserts. Some species, like the rock-wallabies (*Petrogale* spp.), inhabit rocky outcrops and cliffs.\n- **New Guinea**: Tree-kangaroos (*Dendrolagus* spp.) are primarily found in the rainforests of New Guinea and parts of northeastern Australia (Queensland). They are adapted to an arboreal lifestyle, unlike most other macropods.\n- **Nearby Islands**: Some species, such as certain wallabies, are found on islands near Australia, including Tasmania (e.g., the Tasmanian pademelon, *Thylogale billardierii*).\n- **Introduced Populations**: Some macropod species, like the red-necked wallaby (*Notamacropus rufogriseus*), have been introduced to places like New Zealand and parts of Europe, where they have established feral populations.\n\n### First Appearance of Macropodidae\n- The Macropodidae family first appeared in the fossil record during the **late Oligocene to early Miocene**, approximately **25\u201320 million years ago (mya)**, in what is now Australia. Early macropods were likely small, forest-dwelling animals, quite different from the large, hopping species seen today.\n- Fossil evidence suggests that the ancestors of modern macropods diverged from other diprotodontian marsupials during this period. One of the earliest known genera, *Nambaroo*, from the late Oligocene, represents a primitive macropod form.\n- Over time, as Australia's climate became more arid and grasslands expanded during the Miocene (23\u20135 mya), macropods evolved larger body sizes and adaptations for hopping, which allowed them to cover vast distances efficiently in open environments.\n\n### Extinction in Macropodidae\nWhile many macropod species are still extant, several have gone extinct, particularly during the late Pleistocene and into the Holocene, often due to climate change, habitat alteration, and human impacts. Below are details on extinct macropods and when they became extinct:\n- **Megafaunal Extinctions (Late Pleistocene, ~50,000\u201340,000 years ago)**:\n  During the late Pleistocene, Australia experienced a wave of megafaunal extinctions, likely driven by a combination of climate change and human arrival (the first Aboriginal peoples arrived around 65,000\u201350,000 years ago). Several large macropod species disappeared during this time.\n  - *Procoptodon goliah*: This was the largest known kangaroo, standing up to 3 meters (10 feet) tall and weighing around 200\u2013240 kg (440\u2013530 lbs). It became extinct around **40,000 years ago**. Fossils suggest it was a browser with adaptations for reaching high vegetation.\n  - *Sthenurus* spp.: These were short-faced kangaroos, a genus of large macropods with several species that went extinct around the same time as *Procoptodon*, approximately **40,000\u201350,000 years ago**. They were likely browsers rather than grazers.\n  - *Simosthenurus* spp.: Another genus of large, extinct macropods, closely related to *Sthenurus*, which also disappeared during the late Pleistocene, around **40,000 years ago**.\n- **Recent Extinctions (Holocene, post-European settlement)**:\n  After European colonization of Australia in the late 18th century, several smaller macropod species became extinct due to habitat destruction, introduced predators (like foxes and cats), and competition with livestock.\n  - *Lagorchestes leporides* (Eastern Hare-Wallaby): This small macropod became extinct in the late 19th century, with the last confirmed sighting in **1890**. Its decline was likely due to habitat loss and predation by introduced species.\n  - *Onychogalea lunata* (Crescent Nail-Tail Wallaby): This species became extinct around the mid-20th century, with the last confirmed sighting in **1956**. It succumbed to similar pressures as other small macropods, including predation and habitat alteration.\n  - *Caloprymnus campestris* (Desert Rat-Kangaroo): This small macropod is considered extinct, with the last confirmed sighting in **1935**. Its extinction is attributed to habitat changes and predation by introduced species.\n\n### Current Status of Macropodidae\n- Many macropod species are still thriving, such as the red kangaroo and eastern grey kangaroo, which are abundant in Australia. However, several smaller species, especially certain wallabies and hare-wallabies, are endangered or critically endangered due to ongoing threats like habitat loss, climate change, and predation by invasive species.\n- Conservation efforts, including breeding programs, habitat restoration, and predator control, are in place to protect vulnerable macropod species.\n\nIf you'd like more specific information on a particular genus or species within Macropodidae, let me know!"

    "Macropodiformes": {
        "ancestor": "Diprotodontia",
        "info": "**Macropodiformes Overview**\n\nMacropodiformes is a suborder of marsupials within the order Diprotodontia, which includes some of the most iconic Australian mammals such as kangaroos, wallabies, and their relatives. The name \"Macropodiformes\" is derived from Greek, meaning \"large foot,\" referring to the characteristic large hind feet of many species in this group, which are adapted for hopping. This suborder encompasses three main families: Macropodidae (kangaroos, wallabies, and tree-kangaroos), Potoroidae (potoroos, bettongs, and the rat-kangaroos), and Hypsiprymnodontidae (which includes only the musky rat-kangaroo, considered a more primitive member of the group).\n\nBelow is detailed information on the species distribution, evolutionary history (when they first appeared), and extinction status of Macropodiformes as a group, with specific notes on notable extinct species.\n\n---\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nMacropodiformes are primarily native to Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands, reflecting their Gondwanan origins. Their distribution is tied to a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forests, woodlands, and mountainous regions, showcasing their adaptability to diverse environments.\n\n- **Macropodidae (Kangaroos, Wallabies, Tree-Kangaroos):** This family is the largest and most diverse within Macropodiformes. Species are found across mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and some surrounding islands. For example:\n  - The red kangaroo (*Macropus rufus*) inhabits arid and semi-arid regions of central and western Australia.\n  - Tree-kangaroos, such as the Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo (*Dendrolagus goodfellowi*), are found in the rainforests of New Guinea and parts of northeastern Queensland, Australia.\n  - Wallabies, like the swamp wallaby (*Wallabia bicolor*), are distributed in eastern Australia and Tasmania in forested and scrubland areas.\n- **Potoroidae (Potoroos, Bettongs, Rat-Kangaroos):** This family is primarily found in Australia, with some species historically present in Tasmania. They inhabit a range of environments, from coastal heathlands to forests. For instance:\n  - The long-nosed potoroo (*Potorous tridactylus*) is found in southeastern Australia and Tasmania.\n- **Hypsiprymnodontidae (Musky Rat-Kangaroo):** This family contains a single living species, the musky rat-kangaroo (*Hypsiprymnodon moschatus*), which is restricted to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is considered a \"living fossil\" due to its primitive traits compared to other macropodiforms.\n\n---\n\n### **When Macropodiformes First Appeared**\nThe evolutionary history of Macropodiformes dates back to the Paleogene period, with their origins tied to the broader radiation of marsupials in Australia following the continent's separation from other landmasses during the breakup of Gondwana. Fossil evidence suggests that the earliest macropodiform-like ancestors appeared during the late Eocene to early Oligocene, approximately 35\u201340 million years ago (mya), though the definitive members of the suborder emerged later.\n\n- The earliest known macropodiform fossils, from primitive forms related to the musky rat-kangaroo (*Hypsiprymnodon*), date to the Oligocene (around 25\u201330 mya) in Australia. These early forms were likely small, forest-dwelling omnivores or insectivores.\n- By the Miocene (23\u20135 mya), more derived macropodiforms, including ancestors of modern kangaroos and wallabies, began to diversify as Australia's climate became more arid, favoring adaptations like hopping for energy-efficient locomotion over long distances.\n- The family Macropodidae, in particular, underwent significant diversification during the Pliocene and Pleistocene (5\u20132.5 mya), with the appearance of large-bodied kangaroos adapted to open grasslands.\n\nMolecular studies suggest that the divergence between the major families within Macropodiformes (Hypsiprymnodontidae, Potoroidae, and Macropodidae) occurred around 25\u201330 mya, aligning with fossil evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Extinction Status and When Extinctions Occurred**\nWhile many species of Macropodiformes are still extant, the suborder includes both living and extinct species. Extinctions have occurred over millions of years due to natural environmental changes, as well as more recent human-induced factors such as habitat destruction, introduced predators, and climate change. Below is an overview of extinction within the group, focusing on notable extinct species and broader trends.\n\n- **Extant Species:** Many macropodiforms are still alive today, including well-known species like the eastern grey kangaroo (*Macropus giganteus*), red-necked wallaby (*Macropus rufogriseus*), and musky rat-kangaroo (*Hypsiprymnodon moschatus*). However, several extant species are threatened or endangered due to habitat loss and predation by introduced species like foxes and feral cats. For example, the northern bettong (*Bettongia tropica*) is critically endangered.\n- **Extinct Species and Timing of Extinctions:**\n  - **Pleistocene Megafaunal Extinctions (circa 50,000\u201340,000 years ago):** During the late Pleistocene, Australia experienced a wave of megafaunal extinctions, likely driven by a combination of climate change and human arrival (indigenous Australians are thought to have arrived around 65,000\u201350,000 years ago). Several large macropodiform species went extinct during this period, including:\n    - *Procoptodon goliah*: A giant short-faced kangaroo, standing up to 3 meters (10 feet) tall and weighing around 230 kg (500 lbs). Fossils indicate it lived in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia and likely went extinct around 40,000 years ago.\n    - *Sthenurus spp.*: A genus of large, robust kangaroos with short faces, adapted to browsing rather than grazing. They disappeared around the same time as *Procoptodon*, likely due to habitat changes and human hunting pressures.\n    - *Simosthenurus spp.*: Another extinct genus of large kangaroos, closely related to *Sthenurus*, which also went extinct during the late Pleistocene.\n  - **Recent Extinctions (Post-European Settlement, 18th\u201320th Centuries):** Since European colonization of Australia in the late 18th century, several smaller macropodiform species, particularly from the family Potoroidae, have gone extinct due to habitat destruction, introduced predators, and competition with invasive species like rabbits. Examples include:\n    - **Desert Rat-Kangaroo (*Caloprymnus campestris*):** Last reliably sighted in 1935, this species from central Australia is considered extinct, likely due to habitat alteration and predation by introduced species like cats and foxes.\n    - **Broad-faced Potoroo (*Potorous platyops*):** Extinct since the 19th century, last recorded in 1875 in Western Australia. Its decline was likely caused by habitat clearing and introduced predators.\n    - **Eastern Hare-Wallaby (*Lagorchestes leporides*):** Extinct by the late 19th century (last recorded in 1890), this species from southeastern Australia succumbed to habitat loss and predation.\n\n- **Ongoing Threats:** Many surviving macropodiform species are at risk of extinction. For instance, several species of rock-wallabies (*Petrogale spp.*) and tree-kangaroos (*Dendrolagus spp.*) are endangered due to habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic pressures.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- **Distribution:** Macropodiformes are predominantly found in Australia and New Guinea, with species adapted to a wide range of habitats from arid deserts to tropical rainforests.\n- **First Appearance:** The suborder's origins trace back to the late Eocene/early Oligocene (35\u201340 mya), with significant diversification during the Miocene and Pliocene as Australia\u2019s environment changed.\n- **Extinction Status:** While many species remain extant, numerous macropodiforms, especially large megafaunal kangaroos like *Procoptodon goliah* (extinct ~40,000 years ago) and smaller species like the desert rat-kangaroo (extinct ~1935), have gone extinct due to natural and human-induced causes. Ongoing conservation efforts are critical for the survival of remaining threatened species.\n\nIf you'd like detailed information on a specific species or family within Macropodiformes, please let me know!"

It was much larger than modern echidnas, estimated to weigh around 30 kg (66 lbs).  \n   - **Extinction**: This species became extinct approximately 40,000\u201350,000 years ago, likely due to a combination of climate change and human hunting after the arrival of Aboriginal Australians.  \n   - **Fossil Evidence**: Fossils have been found in Mammoth Cave, Western Australia, providing evidence of its large size and adaptations.\n\n2. **Megalibgwilia**  \n   - **Description**: An extinct genus of echidnas from the Miocene to Pleistocene epochs, with species such as *Megalibgwilia ramsayi* and *Megalibgwilia robusta*. These were also larger than modern echidnas.  \n   - **Extinction**: Extinct by the late Pleistocene, around 50,000 years ago, likely due to similar environmental and anthropogenic pressures as *Murrayglossus hacketti*.  \n   - **Fossil Evidence**: Fossils have been found in various Australian sites, indicating a wider historical distribution of echidnas.\n\n3. **Potential Recent Extinctions**:  \n   - *Zaglossus attenboroughi* (Sir David's long-beaked echidna) is critically endangered and may already be extinct, as it has not been definitively sighted since 1961. If extinct, the exact date is unknown, but it would likely be within the last few decades due to habitat loss and hunting.\n\n### Summary of Extinction Status\n- **Extant Species**: Four species remain, with *Tachyglossus aculeatus* being widespread and stable, while the three *Zaglossus* species are critically endangered and at high risk of extinction.\n- **Extinct Species**: Several prehistoric species and genera, such as *Murrayglossus hacketti* and *Megalibgwilia*, became extinct during the late Pleistocene, likely due to climatic shifts and human impact.\n- **Conservation Concerns**: The long-beaked echidnas (*Zaglossus* spp.) face significant threats from deforestation, hunting, and habitat fragmentation in New Guinea, and their survival is uncertain without conservation intervention.\n\nIf you would like more specific information on a particular species or aspect of Tachyglossidae (e.g., behavior, physiology, or conservation efforts), let me know!"

        "info": "**Dromaius novaehollandiae**, commonly known as the **emu**, is a large, flightless bird native to Australia. It is the only extant species in the genus *Dromaius* and belongs to the family *Casuariidae*, which also includes cassowaries. Below is detailed information about the species, including its distribution, evolutionary history, and conservation status.\n\n### **Species Distribution**\n- **Current Range**: The emu is found across much of mainland Australia, inhabiting a wide variety of environments, including grasslands, savannas, woodlands, and arid regions. They are most common in areas with open landscapes and are less frequently found in dense rainforests or urban areas. Their distribution spans from coastal regions to the interior deserts, though they are absent from Tasmania and some offshore islands.\n- **Historical Range**: Historically, emus were more widespread, with several now-extinct subspecies or closely related species inhabiting islands off Australia\u2019s coast, such as King Island and Kangaroo Island. These populations were driven to extinction due to human activity in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n### **When the Species First Appeared**\n- **Evolutionary History**: The emu is part of the ratite group, a lineage of flightless birds that includes ostriches, cassowaries, rheas, and the extinct moas and elephant birds. Fossil evidence and molecular studies suggest that ratites evolved from a common ancestor around 80\u2013100 million years ago during the Cretaceous period, likely in the supercontinent Gondwana. The divergence of the emu lineage is estimated to have occurred around 30\u201340 million years ago during the Oligocene or Miocene epochs, based on genetic studies.\n- **Fossil Record**: Fossils of *Dromaius novaehollandiae* and related species date back to the Pleistocene epoch (approximately 2.5 million to 11,700 years ago) in Australia. These fossils indicate that emus have been a prominent part of the Australian fauna for millions of years, adapting to the continent\u2019s changing climate and landscapes.\n\n### **Extinction Status**\n- **Is the Species Extinct?**: No, *Dromaius novaehollandiae* is not extinct. The emu is a living species and is classified as **Least Concern** by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its large population and wide distribution across Australia.\n- **Historical Extinctions of Subspecies/Related Populations**: While the mainland emu population remains extant, several insular subspecies or closely related species have gone extinct due to human activities:\n  - **King Island Emu (Dromaius minor)**: A smaller species or subspecies of emu native to King Island (between Tasmania and mainland Australia). It became extinct around 1822 due to hunting by European settlers and habitat destruction.\n  - **Kangaroo Island Emu (Dromaius baudinianus)**: Another small emu species or subspecies native to Kangaroo Island, South Australia. It became extinct around 1827, also due to hunting and habitat loss following European colonization.\n  - **Tasmanian Emu**: A possible subspecies or population of emu that lived in Tasmania. It became extinct in the mid-19th century, likely due to similar pressures from human settlement.\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n- **Conservation and Threats**: While the emu is not currently at risk of extinction, it faces localized threats such as habitat loss due to agriculture, road collisions, and competition with introduced species. In some areas, emus are considered pests by farmers due to crop damage, leading to culling programs (e.g., the infamous \"Emu War\" of 1932 in Western Australia, where the military was deployed to control emu populations with limited success).\n- **Cultural Significance**: The emu holds significant cultural importance to Indigenous Australians, featuring in Dreamtime stories, art, and as a source of food and materials. It is also a national symbol of Australia, appearing on the country\u2019s coat of arms alongside the kangaroo.\n\nIf you would like more specific details on any aspect of the emu (e.g., behavior, ecology, or genetic studies), please let me know!"

        "ancestor": "Dromaiidae",
        "info": "The genus **Dromaius** refers to a group of large, flightless birds commonly known as emus, native to Australia. The most well-known and extant species within this genus is **Dromaius novaehollandiae**, the common emu. However, the genus also includes several extinct species. Below is detailed information on the genus Dromaius, including species distribution, first appearance, and extinction details for relevant species.\n\n### General Overview of Dromaius\n- **Family**: Casuariidae (related to cassowaries)\n- **Common Name**: Emus\n- **Characteristics**: Large, flightless birds with long legs, adapted for running at high speeds (up to 50 km/h or 31 mph). They are the second-largest living birds by height, after ostriches.\n- **Habitat**: Varied environments including grasslands, savannas, and forests across Australia.\n\n### Species Distribution\n1. **Dromaius novaehollandiae (Common Emu)**  \n   - **Distribution**: Found across most of mainland Australia, in a variety of habitats including arid and semi-arid regions, grasslands, woodlands, and coastal areas. They are absent from densely forested areas, urban centers, and extremely arid deserts.\n   - **Status**: Extant (not extinct). Listed as \"Least Concern\" by the IUCN, though populations can be affected by habitat loss and human activity.\n   - **Note**: Historically, emus were also present on some offshore islands like Tasmania and Kangaroo Island, but those populations became extinct (see extinct subspecies below).\n\n2. **Extinct Subspecies of Dromaius novaehollandiae**  \n   - **Dromaius novaehollandiae diemenensis (Tasmanian Emu)**  \n     - **Distribution**: Once native to Tasmania.\n     - **Extinction**: Became extinct around the mid-19th century, likely due to hunting and habitat destruction by European settlers.\n   - **Dromaius novaehollandiae baudinianus (Kangaroo Island Emu)**  \n     - **Distribution**: Native to Kangaroo Island, South Australia.\n     - **Extinction**: Became extinct by the early 19th century (around 1827), due to hunting and habitat alteration.\n   - **Dromaius novaehollandiae minor (King Island Emu)**  \n     - **Distribution**: Native to King Island, between Tasmania and mainland Australia.\n     - **Extinction**: Became extinct by 1805, primarily due to hunting by sealers and early settlers.\n\n3. **Dromaius ater (Black Emu)**  \n   - **Distribution**: A distinct extinct species once found on King Island and possibly other nearby islands.\n   - **Extinction**: Became extinct by the early 19th century (around 1802-1805), due to hunting and habitat destruction by European settlers and sealers.\n\n### First Appearance\n- The genus **Dromaius** is believed to have evolved during the Miocene epoch, approximately 15-20 million years ago, based on fossil evidence of early ratites (the group of flightless birds including emus, ostriches, and cassowaries). However, definitive fossil records of Dromaius are more recent.\n- The earliest known fossils attributed to Dromaius date back to the Pliocene epoch, around 5 million years ago, in Australia. These fossils suggest that emus diverged from their closest relatives, the cassowaries, during this period as part of the evolutionary radiation of ratites in the southern hemisphere after the breakup of Gondwana.\n\n### Extinction Details\n- As noted above, while the common emu (**Dromaius novaehollandiae**) survives on mainland Australia, several subspecies and one distinct species (**Dromaius ater**) became extinct in the 19th century due to human activities such as hunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of invasive species.\n- The extinct populations were primarily island-dwelling, which made them more vulnerable to rapid population declines due to limited range and resources.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Emus are culturally significant to Indigenous Australians, featuring in Dreamtime stories and as a source of food and materials.\n- The common emu plays an important ecological role in seed dispersal and maintaining grassland ecosystems through grazing.\n- Fossil evidence suggests that other extinct species or subspecies of Dromaius may have existed in prehistoric times, potentially larger or smaller than the modern emu, but these are less well-documented.\n\nIf you would like more specific details about a particular species or subspecies within Dromaius, or about their evolutionary history, let me know!"

The family is part of the order Casuariiformes, which also includes cassowaries. Below is detailed information on the Dromaiidae family, focusing on species distribution, their first appearance in the fossil record, and their status regarding extinction.\n\n### Species in the Dromaiidae Family\nThe Dromaiidae family currently includes only one living species:\n- **Dromaius novaehollandiae** (Common Emu): This is the only extant (living) species of emu and is the second-largest living bird by height, after the ostrich.\n\nHistorically, the family included several extinct species, which are discussed below under extinction.\n\n### Species Distribution\n- **Living Species (Dromaius novaehollandiae)**:\n  - The Common Emu is widely distributed across most of mainland Australia. It inhabits a variety of environments, including grasslands, savannas, and forests, but tends to avoid dense rainforests and extremely arid deserts unless water is available.\n  - Emus are nomadic and can travel long distances in search of food and water, often following rainfall patterns.\n  - Historically, emus were also found on some offshore islands, such as Tasmania and Kangaroo Island, but these populations are now extinct (see below for details).\n\n### First Appearance\n- The Dromaiidae family, along with other ratites (flightless birds like ostriches and cassowaries), likely originated from a common ancestor during the Cretaceous period, over 66 million years ago, before the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. This allowed ratites to diversify across the southern continents.\n- Fossil evidence suggests that early members of the Dromaiidae family appeared in Australia during the Eocene epoch, approximately 56 to 33.9 million years ago. However, definitive emu-like fossils are more commonly dated to the Miocene epoch (23 to 5.3 million years ago).\n- The genus **Dromaius** likely evolved more recently, with fossils of recognizable emu species appearing in the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs (around 5 million to 10,000 years ago).\n\n### Extinction and Status of Species\n- **Living Species**:\n  - **Dromaius novaehollandiae** (Common Emu): Not extinct. The species is classified as \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with a stable population across mainland Australia. However, it has disappeared from some areas due to habitat loss and human activity.\n  \n- **Extinct Species and Subspecies**:\n  The Dromaiidae family once included several species and subspecies of emus, many of which became extinct due to human activity, climate change, or a combination of factors. Below are the notable extinct members:\n  1. **Dromaius baudinianus** (Kangaroo Island Emu):\n     - Distribution: Endemic to Kangaroo Island, off the coast of South Australia.\n     - Extinction: Became extinct around 1827, primarily due to hunting by European settlers and habitat destruction.\n  2. **Dromaius ater** (King Island Emu):\n     - Distribution: Native to King Island, located between Tasmania and mainland Australia.\n     - Extinction: Became extinct around 1822, also due to hunting and habitat loss following European colonization.\n  3. **Dromaius minor** (Tasmanian Emu):\n     - Distribution: Found in Tasmania.\n     - Extinction: Became extinct around the mid-19th century (circa 1850), likely due to hunting and competition with introduced species.\n  4. **Dromaius diemenensis** (sometimes considered a subspecies of D. novaehollandiae):\n     - Distribution: Also found in Tasmania.\n     - Extinction: Disappeared around the same time as D. minor, likely for similar reasons.\n  5. Other extinct forms:\n     - Fossil evidence from the Pleistocene epoch indicates the existence of larger emu species or subspecies in Australia, some of which may have coexisted with early humans. These likely went extinct due to climate change and human hunting pressures after the arrival of Aboriginal Australians around 65,000\u201350,000 years ago.\n\n### Summary of Extinction Timeline\n- Many extinct emu species and subspecies disappeared relatively recently, within the last 200 years, largely due to European colonization, hunting, and habitat destruction.\n- Prehistoric extinctions of larger or different emu forms occurred during the late Pleistocene, likely linked to human arrival and environmental changes.\n\nIf you have further questions about specific species within Dromaiidae or related topics, feel free to ask!"

        "info": "I believe you are referring to **Ratites**, a group of large, flightless birds that belong to the infraclass Palaeognathae. The term \"Ratitae\" was historically used to classify these birds, though modern taxonomy often groups them under the broader term Palaeognathae, which includes both ratites and tinamous (a related group of flying birds). Ratites are characterized by their flat breastbones (lacking the keel necessary for flight muscles), long legs adapted for running, and generally large body sizes. Common examples include ostriches, emus, cassowaries, rheas, and kiwis.\n\nBelow is detailed information on ratites as a group, including their distribution, evolutionary history, and extinction status of specific species:\n\n---\n\n### **General Overview of Ratites**\nRatites are a diverse group of flightless birds found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. They are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor that was likely flightless, with their distribution reflecting the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. Their inability to fly is thought to be a result of evolutionary adaptation to environments with few predators, allowing them to grow larger and rely on running for survival.\n\n---\n\n### **Species Distribution**\nRatites are native to several continents, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. Their current distribution is as follows:\n\n1. **Ostrich (Struthio spp.)**  \n   - **Location**: Native to Africa, particularly in savannas, grasslands, and deserts. The common ostrich (Struthio camelus) is found across sub-Saharan Africa, while the Somali ostrich (Struthio molybdophanes) is found in the Horn of Africa.  \n   - **Note**: Ostriches have been introduced to other regions, such as Australia, for farming.\n\n2. **Rhea (Rhea spp.)**  \n   - **Location**: Native to South America, found in grasslands, savannas, and scrublands. The greater rhea (Rhea americana) is distributed across Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia, while the lesser rhea (Rhea pennata) is found in southern Argentina and Chile, including Patagonia.\n\n3. **Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae)**  \n   - **Location**: Native to Australia, inhabiting a wide range of environments including grasslands, savannas, and forests across most of the continent.\n\n4. **Cassowary (Casuarius spp.)**  \n   - **Location**: Native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea (Papua New Guinea and Indonesia) and northeastern Australia. There are three extant species: the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius), northern cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus), and dwarf cassowary (Casuarius bennetti).\n\n5. **Kiwi (Apteryx spp.)**  \n   - **Location**: Native to New Zealand, found in forests, scrublands, and grasslands. There are five recognized species, including the North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) and the little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii).\n\n---\n\n### **When Ratites First Appeared**\nRatites are an ancient group of birds, with their origins tracing back to the early Cenozoic Era, likely shortly after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs around 66 million years ago. Molecular and fossil evidence suggests the following timeline:\n\n- The common ancestor of ratites and tinamous likely emerged around **70\u201380 million years ago** during the Late Cretaceous, before the breakup of Gondwana.\n- The divergence of modern ratite lineages (ostriches, rheas, emus, cassowaries, and kiwis) likely occurred between **60 and 50 million years ago** during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs, as Gondwana fragmented into separate continents.\n- Fossil evidence of early ratites includes fragments from the Paleocene and Eocene of South America and Africa, supporting the idea that they evolved on Gondwana before its breakup.\n\nTheir flightlessness is thought to have developed early in their evolutionary history, possibly as an adaptation to terrestrial environments with limited need for flight.\n\n---\n\n### **Extinction Status and Extinct Species**\nWhile several ratite species are still extant, some lineages and species have gone extinct, largely due to human activity, habitat loss, and the introduction of predators. Below are details on extinct ratites and when they became extinct:\n\n1. **Moas (Family Dinornithidae and Emeidae)**  \n   - **Location**: Native to New Zealand.  \n   - **Description**: Moas were a diverse group of flightless birds, ranging in size from turkey-sized to the giant Dinornis, which stood up to 3.6 meters (12 feet) tall, making it one of the tallest birds ever. There were nine recognized species across two families.  \n   - **When Extinct**: Moas became extinct around the **13th to 15th centuries CE**, primarily due to overhunting by the M\u0101ori people, who arrived in New Zealand around 1300 CE, and habitat destruction caused by fire.  \n   - **Note**: Their extinction is one of the most well-documented examples of human-driven extinction.\n\n2. **Elephant Birds (Family Aepyornithidae)**  \n   - **Location**: Native to Madagascar.  \n   - **Description**: Elephant birds were among the largest birds ever, with some species, like Aepyornis maximus, reaching heights of 3 meters (10 feet) and weighing up to 1,000 kg (2,200 lbs). Their eggs were also enormous, with a volume equivalent to about 150 chicken eggs.  \n   - **When Extinct**: Elephant birds became extinct between the **13th and 17th centuries CE**, likely due to human hunting, egg collection, and habitat loss following human settlement in Madagascar.  \n   - **Note**: Subfossil remains and eggshells provide evidence of their existence into relatively recent times.\n\n3. **Extinct Emu Relatives (Dromaius spp.)**  \n   - **Location**: Australia and nearby islands.  \n   - **Description**: Several smaller species of emus, such as the King Island emu (Dromaius minor) and Kangaroo Island emu, once existed on offshore islands of Australia.  \n   - **When Extinct**: These species became extinct in the **early 19th century** due to hunting and habitat destruction by European settlers. The King Island emu was last recorded around 1805.\n\n---\n\n### **Conservation Status of Extant Ratites**\nWhile some ratite species are thriving, others face significant conservation challenges:\n- **Ostrich**: Not threatened; widely farmed and stable in the wild.\n- **Rhea**: The greater rhea is near threatened due to habitat loss and hunting; the lesser rhea is of least concern but faces local declines.\n- **Emu**: Least concern; widespread and abundant in Australia.\n- **Cassowary**: Endangered (particularly the southern cassowary); threatened by habitat loss, vehicle collisions, and predation by introduced species.\n- **Kiwi**: Several species are endangered or critically endangered due to predation by introduced mammals (e.g., stoats, rats) and habitat loss. Conservation efforts in New Zealand are intensive.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nRatites are an ancient group of flightless birds that first appeared around 70\u201380 million years ago, with modern lineages diversifying around 60\u201350 million years ago. They are distributed across the Southern Hemisphere, including Africa (ostriches), South America (rheas), Australia (emus), New Guinea and Australia (cassowaries), and New Zealand (kiwis). While many ratite species are still extant, notable extinct groups include the moas of New Zealand (extinct by the 15th century) and the elephant birds of Madagascar (extinct by the 17th century), both driven to extinction by human activity. Conservation efforts are crucial for protecting remaining species, especially cassowaries and kiwis, which face ongoing threats.\n\nIf you meant a specific ratite species or a different context for \"Ratitae,\" please clarify, and I\u2019d be happy to provide more targeted information!"

    "Palaeognathae": {
        "ancestor": "Neornithes",
        "info": "**Palaeognathae Overview**\n\nPalaeognathae is a superorder of birds that includes some of the most ancient and primitive living bird lineages. The name \"Palaeognathae\" comes from the Greek words for \"old jaw,\" referring to the unique structure of their palate, which is more reptilian in nature compared to the more derived palate of Neognathae (the other major group of birds). Palaeognathae is characterized by a more rigid and less mobile upper jaw. This group includes both flightless and flying birds, and it is one of the two primary divisions of modern birds (the other being Neognathae).\n\n### Species Distribution\nPalaeognathae consists of two main groups: the ratites (flightless birds) and the tinamous (flying birds). Their current distribution is primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, reflecting their ancient Gondwanan origins, as many of these species evolved on continents that were once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Below is a breakdown of the major groups within Palaeognathae and their distributions:\n\n1. **Ratites (Flightless Birds):**\n   - **Ostriches (Struthioniformes):** Found in Africa, particularly in savannas and deserts. The common ostrich (*Struthio camelus*) is native to sub-Saharan Africa, while the Somali ostrich (*Struthio molybdophanes*) is found in the Horn of Africa.\n   - **Emus (Dromaiiformes):** Native to Australia, primarily in grasslands, savannas, and forests. The emu (*Dromaius novaehollandiae*) is the only surviving species.\n   - **Cassowaries (Casuariiformes):** Found in the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, nearby islands, and northeastern Australia. There are three extant species, with the southern cassowary (*Casuarius casuarius*) being the most well-known.\n   - **Kiwis (Apterygiformes):** Endemic to New Zealand, living in forests and shrublands. There are five species, including the North Island brown kiwi (*Apteryx mantelli*).\n   - **Rheas (Rheiformes):** Native to South America, particularly in grasslands and pampas. There are two extant species: the greater rhea (*Rhea americana*) and the lesser rhea (*Rhea pennata*).\n\n2. **Tinamous (Tinamiformes):**\n   - Tinamous are a family of ground-dwelling birds found in Central and South America, from Mexico to southern Chile and Argentina. They inhabit a variety of environments, including forests, grasslands, and scrublands. There are about 47 species, such as the great tinamou (*Tinamus major*).\n\n3. **Extinct Ratites:**\n   - **Moas (Dinornithiformes):** Once endemic to New Zealand, these large flightless birds inhabited forests and grasslands. They became extinct around the 15th century due to human hunting and habitat destruction by the M\u0101ori.\n   - **Elephant Birds (Aepyornithiformes):** Native to Madagascar, these massive flightless birds lived in forests and wetlands. They became extinct around the 17th\u201318th centuries, likely due to human activity and environmental changes.\n\n### When Palaeognathae First Appeared\nPalaeognathae is considered one of the earliest diverging groups of modern birds (Neornithes), with their origins tracing back to the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 70\u201380 million years ago (mya). Fossil evidence and molecular studies suggest that the split between Palaeognathae and Neognathae occurred shortly after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous (around 66 mya). Some of the earliest known palaeognath fossils, such as those from the Paleocene and Eocene epochs (approximately 66\u201356 mya), indicate that their divergence and diversification were underway during this time.\n\n- The earliest definitive palaeognath fossils are from the Paleocene of South America and Europe, with possible ratite-like fossils from the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar.\n- Molecular clock studies suggest that the major lineages of Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous) diverged during the Paleocene or Eocene, likely after the breakup of Gondwana, which influenced their current distribution.\n\n### Extinction Status and Timing\nWhile many palaeognath species are still extant, several notable lineages within this group have gone extinct, primarily due to human activity and environmental changes. Below are details on extinct groups:\n\n1. **Moas (New Zealand):**\n   - Extinction: Moas became extinct around the 15th century (approximately 1400\u20131500 CE). The arrival of Polynesian settlers (the M\u0101ori) in New Zealand around the 13th century led to overhunting of moas for food, as well as habitat destruction through deforestation and the introduction of predators like rats and dogs.\n   - Species: There were several species of moa, ranging in size from turkey-sized to the giant *Dinornis*, which stood up to 3.6 meters (12 feet) tall.\n\n2. **Elephant Birds (Madagascar):**\n   - Extinction: Elephant birds became extinct between the 17th and 18th centuries (approximately 1600\u20131700 CE). Their extinction is attributed to human hunting, habitat loss due to deforestation, and possibly the harvesting of their large eggs.\n   - Species: The largest species, *Aepyornis maximus*, was one of the heaviest birds ever, weighing up to 1,000 kg (2,200 lbs).\n\n3. **Other Extinct Ratites:**\n   - Some prehistoric ratite lineages, such as *Lithornis* (an early flying palaeognath from the Paleocene and Eocene of North America and Europe), became extinct millions of years ago due to natural causes like climate change and competition.\n\n### Current Status of Extant Palaeognathae\nMany surviving palaeognath species are threatened or endangered due to habitat loss, predation by introduced species, and human activity. For example:\n- Several kiwi species in New Zealand are critically endangered due to predation by introduced mammals like stoats and cats.\n- Cassowaries in Australia and New Guinea face threats from habitat destruction and vehicle collisions.\n\nIn summary, Palaeognathae represents an ancient and diverse group of birds with origins dating back to the Late Cretaceous. While many species have persisted into modern times, significant extinctions have occurred, particularly among the large flightless ratites like moas and elephant birds, largely due to human influence. Their distribution remains a testament to their Gondwanan origins, with most species confined to the Southern Hemisphere."

However, many individual species and subgroups within the superphylum have experienced extinction over the course of Earth's history. The most famous extinction events, such as the Permian and Cretaceous mass extinctions, affected various members of Ecdysozoa, leading to the loss of numerous species, particularly among arthropods and other related groups. Despite these events, the Ecdysozoa remain incredibly diverse and abundant in the present day."

Here's some information about this species:\n\n### Distribution:\nDomestic horses are found worldwide, adapted to a wide variety of environments. They are particularly common in areas where human populations live, as horses have historically been used for transportation, labor, companionship, and recreational activities. Their domestication has allowed them to thrive in diverse climates, from the deserts of the Middle East to the plains of North America.\n\n### First Appearance:\nThe domestic horse was first domesticated around 4,000 to 6,000 years ago. Although there are debates about the exact origin of domestication, it is generally believed to have occurred on the steppes of Central Asia, especially in regions that are now part of modern-day Ukraine, southwest Russia, and west Kazakhstan.\n\n### Extinction Status:\nEquus ferus caballus, the modern domestic horse, is not extinct. It is a subspecies of Equus ferus, which includes both domestic horses and their closest wild relatives. While the domestic horse thrives alongside human societies, certain wild relatives within the genus have faced extinction. Notably, the Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), sometimes classified as a separate species, is the only remaining true wild horse species, although it had become extinct in the wild and was reintroduced through conservation efforts.\n\nIn terms of ancient relatives, some subspecies and ancestral forms of wild horses did become extinct due to a variety of factors, including climate changes and human encroachment, but the domestic horse remains widespread and diverse due to its close relationship with human culture and activity."

The species Equus ferus originally emerged in the Late Pleistocene era, roughly around 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. Within this species, three primary subspecies are recognized: \n\n1. **Equus ferus ferus**: This is the Eurasian wild horse, commonly known as the Tarpan. It once roamed the steppes of Europe and Asia. The Tarpan became extinct in the wild in the late 19th century, with the last known wild Tarpan dying in Ukraine in 1879. Attempts to recreate the Tarpan through selective breeding have resulted in horses known as \"Heck horses,\" but these are not genetically pure tarpan.\n\n2. **Equus ferus przewalskii**: Known as Przewalski's horse or the Mongolian wild horse, this is the only surviving subspecies of wild horse not domesticated. Przewalski\u2019s horse was once extinct in the wild but has since been reintroduced into the steppe regions of Mongolia and China following successful captive breeding programs. It is currently classified as Endangered but has a stable population trend due to ongoing conservation efforts.\n\n3. **Equus ferus caballus**: This is the domesticated horse, which has spread globally due to human intervention. Domesticated horses have been selectively bred over thousands of years and are used for various purposes, including transportation, agriculture, and recreation.\n\nIn summary, Equus ferus as a species has an expansive historical range across Europe and Asia, with its domesticated descendants now found worldwide.

Termites, meanwhile, are particularly abundant in tropical and subtropical regions, where they play crucial roles in breaking down cellulose and recycling nutrients in ecosystems.\n\n### Appearance in History:\nCockroaches are ancient creatures, with evidence of their existence dating back to the Carboniferous period, approximately 300 million years ago. This makes them one of the oldest known groups of insects. Termites, formerly considered a separate order but now classified within Blattodea due to genetic and evolutionary studies, are believed to have diverged from a common cockroach ancestor around 150 million years ago, during the early Cretaceous period.\n\n### Extinction Status:\nBlattodea, both cockroaches and termites, are not extinct. They are highly adaptable insects with species that exist abundantly across the world. While individual species within the group may become endangered or potentially extinct due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the order as a whole is thriving and showing great resilience in various ecosystems."

It is a highly diverse group within the class Aves and one of the two major subdivisions of the clade Neognathae, the other being the Galloanserae, which includes the order Anseriformes (ducks, geese, and swans) and Galliformes (chickens, turkeys, and their relatives).\n\n### Species Distribution\nNeoaves is distributed worldwide, inhabiting nearly every terrestrial and aquatic habitat on Earth. The group includes numerous orders of birds, such as passerines (perching birds), raptors (birds of prey), seabirds, and many others, making them incredibly adaptable and widespread.\n\n### Appearance in History\nThe evolutionary history of Neoaves is a subject of significant scientific research and discussion. They are believed to have first appeared in the fossil record during the Late Cretaceous period, around 70 to 66 million years ago. This timing coincides with the era preceding the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event that marked the end of the dinosaurs and paved the way for avian diversification in the Cenozoic Era.\n\n### Extinction Status\nNeoaves is not extinct; in fact, it represents the majority of modern bird species we observe today. As a group, they are highly successful and continue to thrive in various environments around the world. However, within Neoaves, some species and subspecies have indeed gone extinct due to factors such as habitat destruction, climate change, and human activities. Conservation efforts continue to focus on preserving the diverse species within this clade."

There are two species within this genus: the Superb Lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae) and the Albert's Lyrebird (Menura alberti).\n\n### Species Distribution:\n- **Superb Lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae):** This species is found primarily in the forests of southeastern Australia, including Victoria and New South Wales. They are most commonly associated with dense, wet forests and sometimes in plantations.\n- **Albert's Lyrebird (Menura alberti):** This species has a much more restricted range, inhabiting a small area in subtropical rainforests of Southeast Queensland and northeastern New South Wales.\n\n### Appearance:\nThe Menura genus is known for its extraordinary tail feathers resembling a lyre, particularly in males during the breeding season. These birds are also renowned for their remarkable ability to mimic natural and anthropogenic sounds from their environment.\n\n### First Appearance:\nThe lyrebirds are part of the suborder Passeri, a division of the passerine birds which dates back millions of years. Fossil evidence and molecular studies have suggested that lyrebirds diverged from other songbirds quite early in their evolutionary history, although precise dating of when the Menura genus specifically appeared is less well-documented.\n\n### Extinction Status:\nNeither of the two Menura species is extinct. However, they are considered near-threatened, primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation, especially in the case of Albert's Lyrebird, which has a limited distribution making it more vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these emblematic birds and their habitats."

Okapis are found in the dense tropical rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n### Evolutionary History:\nThe superfamily Giraffoidea first appeared in the early to middle Miocene epoch, around 20 to 16 million years ago. Their early evolutionary history involved a variety of ancient species, with representatives distributed across parts of Africa and Eurasia.\n\n### Extinct Members:\nGiraffoidea includes several extinct genera and families, such as Palaeomerycidae, Climacoceratidae, and Progiraffidae, among others. Many of these extinct lineages have been identified through fossil records and are known to have lived in different habitats across Africa and Eurasia. \n\n### Extinction:\nWhile the superfamily itself is not extinct, several of its constituent families and genera have gone extinct over millions of years. The exact timing of extinction varies among the groups, but many became extinct before the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,700 years ago, due to climatic changes, environmental shifts, and competition with other species.\n\nOverall, while many of the ancient members of Giraffoidea are extinct, the superfamily is still represented by the living giraffes and okapis, which continue to thrive in their respective environments."

        "info": "Ursus maritimus, commonly known as the polar bear, is a large bear species native to the Arctic regions. Here is some detailed information about this species:\n\n### Distribution\nPolar bears primarily inhabit the circumpolar Arctic, found along the shores and on sea ice of the Arctic Ocean and its surrounding seas and coastlines. They are distributed across several countries, such as Canada, the United States (specifically Alaska), Greenland (Kingdom of Denmark), Norway (including Svalbard), and Russia. Within these areas, they rely heavily on sea ice as a platform for hunting seals, their primary prey.\n\n### First Appearance\nThe polar bear is believed to have evolved from a common ancestor shared with the brown bear (Ursus arctos). Genetic studies suggest that polar bears started diverging from the brown bear lineage about 400,000 to 600,000 years ago. This adaptation to the Arctic environment has led to several distinct characteristics seen in polar bears today, such as their white fur, which provides camouflage in the snowy habitat, and their specialized hunting skills.\n\n### Status\nPolar bears are not extinct; however, they are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to threats from climate change, habitat loss, and declining sea ice levels. The melting of Arctic sea ice due to global warming poses a significant challenge to their survival, as it impacts their ability to find and catch prey.\n\nConservation efforts are in place to manage and mitigate these threats, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting critical habitats, and monitoring polar bear populations closely. Despite the challenges, polar bears continue to roam their Arctic habitat, but their future remains uncertain amid ongoing environmental changes."

However, the specific species, Raphus cucullatus, was first documented in the 16th and 17th centuries by Dutch sailors when Mauritius began to be explored in the early 1600s.\n\n### Extinction\nThe dodo became extinct in the late 17th century. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo occurred in 1662. The extinction was primarily due to human activities, including hunting by sailors and invasive species brought by humans such as rats, pigs, and monkeys, which fed on dodo eggs and competed for food resources. The destruction of their habitat also contributed to their extinction.\n\nThe dodo has since become an iconic symbol of human-induced extinction and the fragility of island ecosystems."

The generally accepted date of extinction is around 1681. Overhunting by sailors, introduction of non-native animals such as rats and pigs, and habitat destruction contributed to their decline.\n\n### Rodrigues Solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria)\n- **Distribution**: This species was native to Rodrigues, another island in the Indian Ocean, about 560 kilometers east of Mauritius.\n- **Appearance**: Like the dodo, the Rodrigues solitaire evolved on an isolated island, leading to its flightlessness. It was larger than the dodo and shared similar ecological niches.\n- **Extinction**: The Rodrigues solitaire is believed to have become extinct by the late 18th century. The last reported sighting was around 1761.

The two main families within this order are the Columbidae (the pigeons and doves) and the extinct Raphidae (which included the dodo).\n\n### Distribution\nColumbiformes are highly adaptable and are found on every continent except Antarctica. They are particularly diverse in the Indomalayan and Australasian regions. Urban areas worldwide commonly host species like the Rock Pigeon (Columba livia), which has been widely domesticated and introduced beyond its original range in Europe and Western Asia.\n\n### Appearance in History\nThe Columbiformes have a long evolutionary history, with fossil records indicating their presence as far back as the Paleogene period. This suggests that they appeared approximately 60-65 million years ago, shortly after the extinction event that ended the reign of the dinosaurs.\n\n### Extinct Species\nThe most famous extinct member of this order is the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), which was endemic to Mauritius. The dodo became extinct in the late 17th century, around 1681, due to a combination of overhunting by humans, predation by introduced species, and habitat destruction. Another notable extinct species is the Rodriguez Solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria), from the nearby island of Rodrigues, which was last seen around the late 1700s. Both species belonged to the now-extinct family Raphidae.\n\nOverall, while some species have become extinct, Columbiformes continues to thrive and remain a diverse and widespread order of birds today."

It had a distinctive appearance with its dog-like head, yellow-brown fur, and characteristic dark stripes across its back, which is why it is often referred to as the Tasmanian tiger.\n\n**Species Distribution:**\nThe thylacine was once widespread across continental Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea. However, by the time of European settlement in Australia, its range was largely confined to Tasmania. This retreat to Tasmania is thought to have been due to competition with the dingo on the Australian mainland and possibly other ecological factors.\n\n**First Appearance:**\nAlthough the exact date of the species' emergence is uncertain, the thylacine is believed to have existed for several million years. Fossil evidence suggests that the thylacines, as a group, originated about 4 million years ago, with the species Thylacinus cynocephalus evolving later within this lineage.\n\n**Extinction:**\nThe thylacine became extinct in the 20th century. The last known thylacine in captivity died on September 7, 1936, at the Hobart Zoo in Tasmania. This event marked the effective extinction of the species, although there were unverified sightings reported long after this date. The extinction was primarily due to hunting, bounties offered by the government, habitat destruction, and competition with domestic dogs. Disease is also suspected to have contributed to their decline. Officially, the thylacine was declared extinct by international bodies in the years following the last confirmed sighting.\n\nDespite its extinction, the thylacine remains a symbol of Australian wildlife and a cautionary tale about the consequences of human impact on species' survival.
